SUMMARY:After describing your infrastructure as code, reuse that to monitor it
DESCRIPTION: <p>Having difficulties with passively testing your infrastructure with old-school supervision software ? Your infrastructure description differs from your monitoring configuration ? Having trouble communicating between ops and monitoring ? Use Salt configuration management to change that.</p><p>Once you start using configuration management systems like Salt and describe your infrastructure as code, you can then re-use that description to generate monitoring configuration for various existing monitoring solutions (nagios, shinken, etc.).</p><p>You can also use Salt to orchestrate the checks and use other data silos to explore your supervision.</p>

SUMMARY:Where is LLVM being used today?
DESCRIPTION: <p>LLVM has been around for over a decade and is more popular than ever. Its combination of an easy to use API coupled with high quality documentation has lowered the barrier to compiler development significantly.This has led to a strong adoption of LLVM in many different areas and as a result we can see a wide range of projects using LLVM today. Projects using LLVM cover a large spectrum of domains, ranging from classic C/C++ toolchains to code obfuscation engines and binary translators.The vast number of different projects based on LLVM and the fact that new projects are appearing constantly makes it increasingly hard to keep track of all of them.This talk attempts to summarize the current landscape of projects which are using LLVM in one way or another.The focus of this talk is on projects using LLVM rather than the LLVM compiler infrastructure itself.</p>

SUMMARY:A New Patchwork
DESCRIPTION: <p>Mailing lists are the bedrock of many open source software projects, and have been so since the early days of the Internet. However, mailing lists can struggle to compete with code collaboration tools like Gerrit and Rietveld, many of which offer features such as integration with automated testing tools and patch tracking. How can such features be integrated into existing, mailing list-based projects like the Linux kernel or DPDK? The presenter reports on the ongoing work around the widely-deployed 'patchwork' tool to do just this.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>This presentation will describe the Apertium project (http://www.apertium.org). Apertium develops a free/open-source platform for machine translation and language technology. Apertium also develops data for many languages, with a focus on lesser-resourced and marginalised languages, but also develops data for larger languages. The platform, including data for tens of language pairs, a translation engine and auxiliary tools is being developed around the world, both in universities and companies and by a growing numbers independent free-software developers. There are currently 40 published language pairs within the project (including a number of "firsts" — for example Spanish—Occitan, Breton—French, Basque—Spanish, North Sámi–Norwegian Bokmål and Kazakh–Tatar among others), and many more in development.</p>

SUMMARY:Tempus - a framework for multimodal trip planning
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open source engines for trip planning are growing in popularity. We are part of the movement by creating our own engine and a framework for the development of new algorithms.</p><p>Tempus focuses on planning trips that involve all possible transport modalities, mixing private and public modes as well as shared vehicles, and on requests with multiple objectives.</p><p>It relies on well-known open source components and standards like PostGIS, QGIS, WPS, boost graph and offers tools for importing routing data from various sources, including OpenStreetMap.</p><p>This presentation will illustrate the overall modular architecture of Tempus built around a C++ core and will detail recent additions to the engine, like the integration of Contraction Hierarchies, thanks to industial parternships.</p>

SUMMARY:Free communications with Free Software
DESCRIPTION: <p>At FOSDEM 2013, leading developers of free real-time communications software dared to get up on stage and ask the question "Can we replace Skype, Viber, Twitter and Facebook?".  Was this the right question and how does it relate to free software development today and in the future?  Pocock talks about what has changed since then and where things are going in this domain in the year ahead, especially with the emergence of WebRTC and the ubiquity of browsers that support it and the opportunities this has created for the world of web development and interaction with other open systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Building open source with open source
DESCRIPTION: <p>The architects who are building MidoNet, an open source network virtualization solution, have chosen open source technologies as building blocks. This session will explore how MidoNet relies on Apache ZooKeeper and Kafka to store the virtual network topology and network state such as MAC and ARP tables. In large deployments involving many compute nodes, we will show the scalability limits of our ZooKeeper-based state table implementation and present a recent design based on Kafka that offers much greater performance.</p>

SUMMARY:Managing Ceph through Cinder using oVirt
DESCRIPTION: <p>The demand for managing a large amount of data in a scalable yet reliable and cost-effective way has became more and more relevant in this day and age.Ceph, a software-defined storage, provides an original solution for this problem and guarantees a resilient and self-healing way for managing large amount of data up to the Exabyte level.In this session I will talk about a new feature introduced in oVirt 3.6 which provides the ability to integrate with Red Hat Ceph storage using Cinder, a storage service used mainly for OpenStack.This integration reveals new opportunities and tools for storage management in a scalable and virtualized way and also opens the door for interesting future integrations with other storage providers.</p>

SUMMARY:Meet a parallel, asynchronous PHP world
DESCRIPTION: <p>We all know how good horizontal scaling is. We also know that PHP is born single threaded, and therefore it’s not the best available tool for heavy processing or intensive batch jobs. In this talk we’ll see how to get through these shortcomings, achieving parallel processing through native solutions such as Process control functions and POSIX functions, but also exploiting more recent techniques such as message queues and nonblocking I/O. We’ll cover a wide range of examples from real world applications, and dealing with tools such as Gearman, RabbitMQ, ReactPHP and Icicle.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Once Upon a Time, Linux distributions were the "center of the universe" for free and open source software. If you wanted to reach users with your project, the best path to do so was to have your software packaged for the "major" Linux distributions of the time. Today, the world looks a lot different with language-specific package managers, microservices and containers, and so on. What's the role of Linux distributions in today's open source world, and where do we go from here?</p>

SUMMARY:An efficient and thread-safe representation of objects for JRuby+Truffle
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will discuss the representation of objects in dynamically-typed languages like Ruby.From the naive hash table used in ruby 1.8.7 to the highly optimized and type-specialized representation,we will take a look at a few common representations for objects with a dynamic number of fields.Advantages and drawbacks will be discussed and in particular the behavior of objects accessed concurrently.Would you expect instance variables to disappear? Or that writing to them would have no effect?If not, come and see why it could happen, and what can be done to fix it and at what cost!</p><p>JRuby+Truffle is a high performance implementation of Ruby being built as an open-source project at Oracle Labs.It uses state-of-the-art research techniques for writing interpreters and dynamic compilersthat allows it to be both significantly faster and simpler than any other implementation of Ruby.It is built on top the of Truffle framework which provide an Object Storage Model.We present a solution to make it behave correctly under concurrent access.</p>

SUMMARY:Scheduling in The Age of Virtualization
DESCRIPTION: <p>Once upon a time, an operating system scheduler was <em>The</em>One_ entity in charge of deciding what  "activity" would run on a physical processor. Furthermore, such "activity" would pretty much all the time be an application (or system) program. Well, guess what: these days, things are more complicated! Applications and physical processors have moved away from each other, as one or more layers have been put in between them. In fact, in a typical virtualization/cloud scenario, we have a hypervisor, providing the abstraction of virtual processors, and it is onto them that applications run. And here we are: running an application inside a virtual machine requires a virtual processor to be scheduled on a physical processor --at the host level-- and the application itself to be scheduler on the virtual processor --at the guest level. So, two schedulers (at least!).</p><p>But how do these two schedulers interact right now? How should they interact ideally? Should they be closely related, completely independent, or something in the middle? Are they better be based on the same algorithm? Or do different layers have different enough needs to require highly specific solutions?</p><p>This talk will go through the above (and more) questions, trying to outline pros and cons of a few approaches. That will happen both in a "theoretical" and practical sense. The latter meaning that we will be looking at some real scheduling traces (at both host and guest level), and at numbers from different benchmarks. The main focus, especially of the 'case study' part, will be on the Xen's scheduler(s) (i.e., on the interactions between Xen's and Linux's schedulers) but we will have a look at a few KVM data points as well.</p><p>One Scheduler to rule them all.

SUMMARY:MIPS, the other side of the embedded
DESCRIPTION: <p>For many years MIPS processors have been involved in the embedded market, particularly in areas related to networks and storage.With the success of the mobile market, and the great evolution of the world linked to the "makers", other architectures (such as ARM), they have reached very large levels of diffusion.Meanwhile, the mips architecture has evolved, introducing innovations and improvements to adapt to both the processor market from performance, both to the world of microcontrollers. The future of MIPS is a new family divided into several generations evolving.During the presentation, after a brief and simplified introduction to architecture, will be shown the technologies available at the time and what will be the future developments.In the presentation will also show some reference platforms (ex. Imagination Creator CI20), and how to work to integrate and port on these platforms.Application examples with yocto and buildroot, to switch to a full distribution (Debian). Finally it will also present a perspective on the use of MIPS in embedded designs.</p>

SUMMARY:Growing the MySQL Ecosystem
DESCRIPTION: <p>How can we grow the MySQL Community?  It has always been hard to find qualified MySQL Developers and Database Administrators and there is still a great shortage.  The NoSQL world has bright shinny 'toys' and MySQL is now in a 'young adult stage'.  With containerization and verbalization there is more demand for the MySQL skills but that does not seem to be growing the community at the same pace.  So how do we promote our community to attract more people, how do we promote the knowledge of MySQL skills to hiring managers, is there a way to mentor new people as does the PHP Community, and how do we provide support for each other.  Please come to provide your ideas so we can get more of us.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>The seL4 microkernel is the world's first OS kernel that is formally verified to contain no bugs. After several years of development as a proprietary technology, the kernel was eventually released as open source in summer 2014. This prompted me to explore the use of seL4 as base platform for the Genode OS framework. The talk will introduce seL4, explain the interplay of Genode with the kernel, and present the current state of development.</p>

The talk will explain how to retrieve the data from the repositories, how to visualize different aspects of it, and how to produce a dashboard with those visualization. The dashboard, once composed, allows for selective filtering, drilling-down, and in general, knowing about the internals of a free, open source software project at any level of detail. Is there a better way of spending 15 minutes?</p>

SUMMARY:Single-pass Graph Streaming Analytics with Apache Flink
DESCRIPTION: <p>Several sources of data consist of events representing relationships between entities, like user interactions in a social network, clicks on pages linking to each other, purchases of products on web stores, etc. These streams of real-time data can be represented as dynamic graphs, where each event adds or updates an edge in the graph.</p><p>Processing dynamic graphs is a challenging task that requires sophisticated state management, snapshotting mechanisms, and incremental graph algorithms. Luckily, several graph computations, like graph statistics, aggregates, and graph sketches, as well as more complex algorithms like connected components and bipartiteness detection, can be computed in a single-pass fashion. Single-pass algorithms process each edge once and do not need to store or access the complete graph state.</p>

SUMMARY:Eternal Plugfest
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open Document Format has been tested at so-called Plugfests over the years. At these plugfests compatibility between ODF implementations is tested. This started out as a manual process with a wiki and USB sticks. ODFAutoTests have increased the amount of testing that can be done at a plugfest. More testing could be plugfests lasted longer. To make that possible, a web server is being developed.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>hanythingondemand (or HOD for short) is a set of scripts to start services, for example a Hadoop cluster, from within another resource management system (e.g., Torque/PBS) on an HPC system. As such, it allows traditional users of HPC systems to experiment with Hadoop and other services, or use it as a production setup if there is no dedicated setup available. Next to Hadoop clusters, HOD can also create HBase databases, IPython notebooks, and set up a Spark environment.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Having spent more than the last decade being the main point of contact for distributions shipping MySQL, then MariaDB Server, it's clear that working with distributions have many challenges. Licensing changes (when MySQL moved the client libraries from LGPL to GPL with a FOSS Exception), ABI changes, speed (or lack thereof) of distribution releases/freezes, supporting the software throughout the lifespan of the distribution, specific bugs due to platforms, and a lot more will be discussed in this talk. Let's not forget the politics. How do we decide "tiers" of importance for distributions? As a bonus, there will be a focus on how much effort it took to "replace" MySQL with MariaDB.</p>

SUMMARY:Building a geo-aware OS
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk, I'll be presenting the tools (geoclue, geocode-glib and GNOME Maps) we have been slowing creating to make GNOME fully geo-aware and and how these tools harness existing open source and open data projects out there. While our focus has been GNOME, most of these tools are very much generic and could (and IMO should) be used by other Linux-based system.</p>

SUMMARY:Digital Hardware Design: Why is it still so hard?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Digital hardware design, or “HDL programming,” is growing in popularity with the widespread availability of FPGA platforms. Yet, the ecosystem around it needs some work. Tooling, the availability of code, licensing and a scattered community make it hard to get started. In this talk, we'll look at the situation today, and where things are going. As newcomer you'll leave the talk with all you need to know to start an FPGA design. And as experienced developer you will get an update on what's going on around you. Because digital hardware design doesn't need to be hard.</p>

SUMMARY:How choosing the Raft consensus algorithm saved us 3 months of development time
DESCRIPTION: <p>Providing full data availability in a degraded cluster requiresa mechanism for coordinating changes to cluster membership in an automated way.</p><p>While developing our GPL distributed storage solution we researchedthe state of the art of consensus algorithms to achieve fault-tolerance.Our first stop was Paxos, which turned out to be complex and lacking accurate and comprehensivespecifications. Without a reference implementation, confusion reigns supreme, andanalyzing all the different variants would have taken us at least 3 months.By contrast Raft defines a single clean way to implement reliable leaderelection. It controls responsiveness with autonomously made decisions ofparticipation in the cluster, while providing data availability.</p><p>In this lightning talk I will recount the road bumps we hit while implementingthe consensus algorithm and the headaches we had before we ditched Paxos.With this head start on Raft, I hope to save my fellow developers from the painwe went through!</p>

SUMMARY:User Space Networking with ODP and/or DPDK
DESCRIPTION: <p>With the recent trend toward moving to a Linux user-space as an environment for packet-processing, hardware vendors have provided their own API in the user-space for accessing data path functions like sending/receiving packets, classification, scheduling and acceleration. However, as the market matures, a shift toward a common API is allowing a degree of portability across hardware platforms. In terms of DPDK or ODP, efforts are in place to create a platform independent and vendor-neutral standard API for optimized packet processing for NFV and traditional networking services. This session will provide a comparative analysis and evolution of both of these standards and how Freescale (NXP) is working to provide support for these common API without sacrificing performance or leveraging specific acceleration advantages of the Freescale data path architectures.</p>

SUMMARY:Qucs: overview, status and roadmap
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk presents Qucs (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) features, the current status of development and the project roadmap.</p><p>Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator. The graphical user interface (GUI) is used for schematic capture and visualization of simulation results. It can simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behavior of the circuit. The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types such as DC, AC, transient, S-parameter, noise analysis, harmonic balance analysis. Digital simulation and circuit optimization are integrated into the GUI and powered by other open-source tools (Icarus-Verilog, freeHDL, ASCO). Besides the library of components it also includes tools for the design of active and passive filters, transmission lines, attenuators and matching circuits. Interfaces for Matlab/Octave and Python are also available.</p><p>The talk will provide an overview of the features and available tools along with a selection of examples. It will present the latest developments including: ongoing migration towards the latest Qt framework; new features related to the “turn-key” Verilog-A (ADMS) model compiler as well as support for other simulation engines (Ngspice, Xyce).</p>

SUMMARY:AAP: An Altruistic Processor
DESCRIPTION: <p>An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is an open hardware 16-bit architecture for deeply embedded applications running on small FPGA devices.  It is somewhat configurable, with a minimum of 4 16-bit general registers, at least one word-addressed code space of up to 16Mword and at least one byte addressed data space of up to 64kbyte.</p><p>The primary role of AAP is as a test bench for compiler backends.  It encapsulates features found in a wide range of popular embedded processors which traditionally cause difficulties for compiler writers.  By contributing it to the official LLVM distribution we hope to provide a solution to these problems for many such compilers..</p><p>A Clang/LLVM implementation for AAP has been submitted as a patch to the mainline development (patches D12191 and D12192). In this talk we will discuss our experience implementing and testing LLVM for this architecture, the architectural features unique to our processor and how these interact with LLVM.  In AAP integers are less than 32-bits, pointers may be word addressed, not unique, and too large to fit in a registers (of which there may be very few).</p>

SUMMARY:Building Data applications with Go: from Bloom filters to Data pipelines
DESCRIPTION: <p>Many people use Go for different projects: WebDev, DevOps or other general-purpose tasks. On another hand,  with all the beauty and performance of the language it could be a good challenger for Data applications.In the talk, we will go through the common problems of Data Engineering. Starting with high-performance caching and probabilistic data structures like Bloom filters, CountMin or Hyperloglog. We will cover all stages of Data Pipelining like writing data producers for open source Apache Kafka or proprietary Amazon Kinesis or Google Pub/Sub with further data consuming and processing.</p>

SUMMARY:Building Linux distribution packages with Docker 
DESCRIPTION: <p>Docker has brought an ease of use without comparison with VMs typically tobuild native upstream distribution packages. Where before it was needed tolaunch a complete environment, copy the sources into it, invoke the build toolsto create the packages and then copy them back to the host, Docker has made allthese steps much easier and straight forward, allowing for more rapid packageproduction and automation.</p><p>This presentation will show a detailed use case for building packages for bothMageia and Fedora with their respective bm or koji tools encapsulated in Dockercontainers. It should help any upstream packager adopt a similar approach tomake his packaging task a breathe.</p>

SUMMARY:Accessing Web Services from IoT Devices
DESCRIPTION: <p>The vast majority of devices in IoT space are constrained devices. A lot recent developments and standard initiatives have addressed connectivity solutions for constrained devices by introducing protocols such as CoAP and MQTT. With connectivity in place, the next challenge is how these devices can make use of the existing Web services. This talk introduces the web service interface (WSI) layer in IoTivity framework to address this challenge. A demo on how IoT devices can seamlessly access cloud Services with the helps of WSI in IoTivity stack will be given.</p>

SUMMARY:Porting HelenOS to RISC-V
DESCRIPTION: <p>RISC-V is the most recent attempt (originally from UC Berkeley) to design a brand new instruction set architecture based on the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. One of its goals is to be completely open and free (both as in free beer and as in free speech) for designers, users and manufacturers. HelenOS is an open source operating system designed and implemented from scratch based on the microkernel multiserver design principles. One of its goals is to provide excellent target platform portability and it currently supports 8 different hardware platforms.</p>

SUMMARY:Testing interoperability with closed-source software through scriptable diplomacy
DESCRIPTION: <p>You, of course, write open-source software. They didn’t. And for the sake of your mobile users, you both need to be friends. Enter Frida, the diplomat (she’s really only a library, but don’t tell anyone). She has coaxing superpowers that allow you to expose the innards of binary-only software, be it other libraries, operating systems, or other OS processes you must deal with. You can program Frida to infiltrate closed-source software, and expose their internals into abstractions you can use for testing the interoperability of your software. Want to lift some of their logic into your mock? Or replace a few functions in their binary code with your mocks? Hopefully, you want to do that using high-level languages such as JavaScript and/or Python, because those are the ones Frida likes the most.</p>

SUMMARY:PSR-7 HTTP messages in the wild
DESCRIPTION: <p>PSR-7 describes common interfaces for representing HTTP messages. HTTP messages are the foundation of web development. Web browsers and HTTP clients such as cURL create HTTP request messages that are sent to a web server, which provides an HTTP response message. Server-side code receives an HTTP request message, and returns an HTTP response message.</p><p>This talk will explain the interfaces defined by PSR-7, how they define the future of interoperability between frameworks and tools. After that there will be a showcase of several implementations and tools such as zend's diactoros package, Guzzle v6, php-http, RelayPHP and other packages that show the real power of shared interfaces for HTTP objects. A clear path to how we can start using these typed objects in our applications today will be shown.</p>

SUMMARY:Building system-on-chips with Migen and MiSoC
DESCRIPTION: <p>Based on Migen, MiSoC is a library of cores and a system-on-chip integration system to build gateware for various applications. MiSoC is lightweight (runs on FPGA devices as small as Spartan-6 LX9 with 32-bit RISC CPU and SDRAM), portable (demonstrated on Xilinx, Altera and Lattice devices) and high performance (e.g. contains the fastest open source DDR3 solution we are aware of). Designing and integrating cores is facilitated by Python and Migen features. Current MiSoC applications include LTE base stations, video processing (Numato Opsis) and experiment control system (ARTIQ).</p>

SUMMARY:Improving Postgres' Buffer Manager
DESCRIPTION: <p>Postgresql's buffer manager has parts where it's showing its age. We'll discuss how it currently works, what problems there are, and what attempts are in progress to rectify these weaknesses:* Lookups in the buffer cache are expensive* The buffer mapping table is organized as a hash table, which makes efficient implementations of prefetching, write coalescing, dropping of cache contents hard* Relation extension scales badly* Cache replacement is inefficient* Cache replacement replaces the wrong buffers</p>

SUMMARY:Community impacts of legal decisions
DESCRIPTION: <p>Legal decisions related to an open source project serve multiple purposes. One of the constituencies of these legal policies is the community of contributors to the project. Unfortunately, the effect of legal policy decisions by a primary copyright holder can have unanticipated negative effects on this constituency.</p><p>Some legal decisions which have an effect on the contributor community are:*  License choice*  Contributor licensing agreements*  Determining origin of contributions and "clearing" them*  Trademark usage policy</p><p>Dave Neary is a community manager with a long history of participating in and organising open source community projects, and he will walk you through some of the ways in which decisions in these areas have actively harmed project growth in the past, and may suggest some alternatives which accomplish similar goals without the same side-effects.</p>

SUMMARY:ClusterShell
DESCRIPTION: <p>HPC administration tasks require admins to run identical commands across their clusters efficiently and frequently.Cluster tools develop again and again their own set of commands to perform similar tasks. Admins often develop their own scripts trying to implement fast execution, not always successfully.ClusterShell proposes to address these problems by offering a new set of command-line tools and a Python framework, both relying on the same optimized code and features. It took the best of famous commands, like pdsh, and improved it. The library can be used to ease admin script development and remove the burden of implementing optimized parallelism.ClusterShell supports multiple execution backends like SSH or RSH variants. Tools from other projects already rely on ClusterShell for their efficient command execution like MilkCheck or Shine. Moreover, ClusterShell offers a powerful way to manage range of nodes which could be used in any tools using its Python API.</p>

FM broadcast is nearly ubiquitous and has a narrow enough bandwidth that very inexpensive hardware all over the world can work with it. It also has an interesting enough structure that allows us to go from simple to more complicated GNU Radio applications for studying all sorts of ways in which we can process it as a signal.</p>

SUMMARY:AAPSIM: Implementing a LLVM based simulator
DESCRIPTION: <p>An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is an open hardware 16-bit architecture for deeply embedded applications running on small FPGA devices.  It is somewhat configurable, with a minimum of 4 16-bit general registers, at least one word-addressed code space of up to 16Mword and at least one byte addressed data space of up to 64kbyte.</p><p>A key part of any implementation of an embedded toolchain is a simulator of the architecture, both such that user written code can be run and so the compiler's implementation itself can be verified. As part of AAP, we have implemented a simulator based on LLVM MC that both runs standalone and as part of a gdb/lldbserver.</p><p>In this talk I will discuss the design and my experiences of using LLVM as the host for a simulator.</p>

SUMMARY:RedMetrics - Data-driven Game Design with Open Analytics
DESCRIPTION: <p>Game developers make heavy use of "metrics" in order to understand how their games are being played by the public. Through recording players' actions within a game, designers can identify weaknesses in the game design, such as sections of the game that are too difficult, or never explored. We have created an open source game analytics service called "RedMetrics" in which all data gathered is freely available online. RedMetrics can gather data from any platform (web, PC, console, etc.) and stores it an open repository. The data is available via a web API as well as a web application. To ease integration, we provide interfaces for the popular game engine Unity as well as for the web browser.</p>

SUMMARY:100% open journey planning 
DESCRIPTION: <p>Take walking paths from OpenStreetMap, take public transport open data in GTFS format, deploy OpenTripPlanner, expose open APIs, customise any of the client applications. This is how next-generation journey planners are being built: open standards, open data, open APIs, open source code. Authorities in places such as Portland, New York State, Netherlands, Finland, Iceland and Oslo are already working this way in collaboration with citizens and businesses. Latest result of this model to replace proprietary solutions is Digitransit, a mobile-first HTML5 passenger information app by the main transport authorities in Finland (Helsinki Regional Transport Authority HSL and Finnish Transport Agency FTA).</p><p>This is an example how more civic tech should be built, which leads to more open source from the government. Transport has proven an easy and interesting field for citizen participation, as everyone has an itch to scratch, and it's visual with maps and realtime data. If the transport data is open in your city, you can set this up. If your city hasn't opened data yet, here's one reason why they should.</p>

SUMMARY:FPGA Manager & devicetree overlays
DESCRIPTION: <p>FPGA Manager &amp; devicetree overlays - Making FPGAs first class citizens in the upstream Linux Kernel</p><p>Static System on Chip (SoC) configurations commonly found in today's embedded systems can be easily describedby devicetree files. These files provide the kernel with the necessary information about hardware devices, their connections, clocks, resets and other properties that could be either runtime probed, or would be provided by the BIOS on normal PC systems.</p><p>FPGAs have been present in embedded systems for a long time. Their reconfigurabilityallows for in-the-field upgrades to large parts of a system's functionality.For this kind of reconfigurability it is sufficient to reload the FPGA image once at boot,and to present the peripherals in the programmable logic parts to the Linux Kernel in the same way as any other hardware.</p><p>With FPGA based SoCs such as Altera's SocFPGA and Xilinx Zynq this model of reconfigurationposes its challenges, as runtime reconfiguration (and even partial reconfiguration)may cause parts of the fabric-based logic to temporarily (or permanently!) disappear.In that case presenting the FPGA based logic to the kernel might lead to issues as thecorresponding device drivers don't get unloaded properly when the corresponding logic goes away.</p><p>Vendor trees (that contain modifications to the Linux Kernel, that have not been upstreamed) provide userland applications with a capability to reload the FPGA image. In this case a hybrid system with in kernel drivers and userland applications is quickly forced into using ugly hacks to make it all work together.</p><p>FPGA manager is a vendor-neutral framework currently under development (will be in 4.4), that allows reloading FPGA images in a safe, clean and intuitive manner, while nicely integrating with the Linux Kernel's driver model.</p><p>To model the dependencies of FPGA based IP in processor based SoC's the SimpleFPGA bus was developed. It allows to specify dependency topologies to reconfigure SoC busses at runtime, while dealing with issues such as runtime clock control, resets, as well as loading the correct (partial) bitstreams through FPGA Manager.</p><p>Originally developed to support the BeagleBone Black's capes that require runtime pinctrl, devicetree overlays can be used to change the Linux Kernel's representation of the devicetree at runtime. Recently merged into upstream devicetree overlays provide a very natural and clean way to describe modifications to the devicetree, while keeping the whole system in a coherent state.</p><p>This talk will give a brief intro to devicetree, the problems related to runtime reconfiguration and then describe the SimpleFPGA bus and FPGA Manager frameworks. Some simple examples using devicetree overlays will be given that will demonstrate why the three elements make for such a compelling combination.</p>

SUMMARY:Writing secure HTML5 applications for automotive systems
DESCRIPTION: <p>Everyone understands why a car should be more secure than a phone. Embedded applications typically request special privileges such as playing sound, sending SMS or geolocating. Those running on vehicles, while having the same requirements, need to be more strictly constrained to prevent dramatic consequences on equipment, driver and passengers.</p><p>The most common motivation to ignore security is cost reduction and time-to-market. Developing secure HTML5 applications should be smooth and simple. This talk presents a model of architecture leveraging modern tools such as Gulp, Angular and Foundation6 to simplify the production of applications for the automotive industry, while respecting strong security constraints.</p>

SUMMARY:MySQL Group Replication or how good theory gets into better practice 
DESCRIPTION: <p>MySQL Group Replication is a recent MySQL plugin that brings togethergroup communication techniques and database replication, providingboth a high availability and a multi-master update everywherereplication solution.</p><p>High availability is achieved through redundancy, by consistentlyreplicating data throughout a set of MySQL servers. Multi-masterupdate everywhere is based on row-level conflict detection on the factthat the plugin leverages distributed coordination among servers todeploy consistent conflict handling. Thus the system behaves as areplicated state machine.To have all this working together, there is an underlying work of awell-known paradigm in distributed computing: Group Communication andDistributed Consensus - that is becoming quite hot in the softwareindustry nowadays, along with with top-notch software architecture.</p><p>Come and learn what it is, where to get it and how to use it. Get toknow how to install, configure and deploy it in your existinginfrastructure.</p>

SUMMARY:Reproducible and User-Controlled Package Management in HPC with GNU Guix
DESCRIPTION: <p>Support teams of high-performance computing (HPC) systems often find themselves between a rock and a hard place: on one hand, they understandably administrate these large systems in a conservative way, but on the other hand, they try to satisfy their users by deploying up-to-date tool chains as well as libraries and scientific software. HPC system users often have no guarantee that they will be able to reproduce results at a later point in time, even on the same system—software may have been upgraded, removed, or recompiled under their feet, and they have little hope of being able to reproduce the same software environment elsewhere. We present GNU Guix and the functional package management paradigm and show how it can improve reproducibility and sharing among researchers with representative use cases.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>A lot of folks are talking about containers vs. virtualization. Sometimes that makes sense, but there are also a number of cases where they're working together. I want to talk about the relationship between virtualization and containers, and some of the efforts to manage virtualization / IaaS technologies with containers to make them easier to deploy and manage. This includes efforts to containerize things like oVirt and OpenStack, as well as the best way to run KVM virtual machines in privileged containers.</p>

SUMMARY:Scylla, a Cassandra-compatible NoSQL database at 2 million requests/s
DESCRIPTION: <p>Scylla is a new NoSQL database, capable of 2 million requests per second per node, while providing Apache Cassandra compatibility and scaling properties. Scylla applies systems programming techniques to a horizontally scalable NoSQL design to achieve extreme performance improvements. As CPU core counts continue to grow, along with the raw speed of networking and storage devices available on a modern system, software design approaches that were valid and safe even a few years ago are no longer sustainable.</p><p>Scylla enables high throughput, low latency, and rapid completion of housekeeping operations such as compaction. Scylla eliminates known performance bottlenecks of existing NoSQL servers by running multiple engines, one per core, each with its own memory, CPU and multi-queue NIC.  Scylla bypasses key performance bottlenecks that can affect NoSQL server performance using per-core memory allocation to avoid locking, and asynchronous I/O for storage to bypass the system page cache.  With Scylla, NoSQL projects can avoid performance uncertainties up front in order to deploy a system that performs and scales with a low risk of unpredictable performance issues later.</p>

SUMMARY:QEMU for Xen secure by default
DESCRIPTION: <p>Xen on x86 platforms offers two kinds of virtual machines: PV and HVM.PV is the oldest kind of guest, doesn't need any emulation, but requiresextensive modifications to the guest operating system kernel. HVM is anewer kind of guest, which exploits hardware virtualization extensions,and offers an emulated PC-like environment. Linux typically runs on Xenas a PV guest but can also run as an HVM guest very efficiently. Windowsruns as an HVM guest only.</p>

SUMMARY:Layers Box
DESCRIPTION: <p>Using cloud providers to run business-critical software is not an option for many small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and worldwide. Also private users are increasingly aware of the privacy risks when relying on the services of big enterprises. Running your own server is often considered "geeky", with only nerds being able to do administrate a server. We want to change that! Our Open Source "Layers Box" is an infrastructure for creating, installing and running packages of inter-dependent self-hosted services on own hardware. We would like to present our approach and inspire the Lightning Talk audience to discuss possible additional use cases and services.</p>

SUMMARY:Sharp.Xmpp, a multiplatform .NET XMPP client library and Android
DESCRIPTION: <h3>Sharp.Xmpp</h3><p>Sharp.Xmpp is a multiplatform, Windows and Android, .NET XMPP client library. It supports IM functionality &amp; a variety of XMPP extensions, is simple and is extensively tested against both Android and Windows platforms. It is a fork of the currently frozen excellent S22.Xmpp project.In the first part of the presentation will discuss Sharp.Xmpp capabilities, protocols supported, examples for usage and extension. The second part will focus for using Sharp.Xmpp for mobile development for Android, lessons and experiences learned.Necessary hooks, alarms, network connection events, ping time, and battery consumption information will be provided, from a Sharp.Xmpp perspective and mobile development using Mono.Sharp.Xmpp since its release has gained some uptake, since, to the best of my knowledge, it one of the very few available modern C# open source XMPP libraries currently available. Participation in the conference will help expand uptake, and its contributor base.</p>

SUMMARY:When is Distribution not Distribution?
DESCRIPTION: <p>When is distribution not distribution?</p><p>‘Distribution’ triggers copyleft obligations, and accurate interpretation of copyleft licences is dependent on an accurate determination of 'distribution'. In the course of other research, we developed a model containing a spectrum of software use-cases illustrating what activities may result in distribution, as defined in law, and which therefore trigger the copyleft conditions in FOSS licences. This talk explains the model, and the use-cases, and explores, from a European Copyright Law perspective, when software can be considered to have been distributed, and what the consequences are for copyleft in each case, with reference to the GPL, AGPL and other FOSS licences.</p>

SUMMARY:Snabb Switch: Riding the HPC wave to simpler, better network appliances
DESCRIPTION: <p>Driven by the needs of scientific computing, rapid rises in memory bandwidth have made it possible to implement high-performance network functions in a radically simpler way.  Snabb Switch rides this wave, bypassing the kernel to process network packets in terse Lua, leaving the programmer free to focus on the essence of their problem.  This talk presents our experiences delivering a carrier-grade implementation of "lightweight 4 over 6", an IPv4-as-a-service architecture that tunnels access to the IPv4 internet through specialized Snabb appliances.</p>

SUMMARY:OpenHPC: Community Building Blocks for HPC Systems
DESCRIPTION: <p>Today, many supercomputing sites spend considerable effort aggregating a largesuite of open-source projects on top of their chosen base Linux distribution inorder to provide a capable HPC environment for their users. They alsofrequently leverage a mix of external and in-house tools to perform softwarebuilds, provisioning, config management, software upgrades, and systemdiagnostics. Although the functionality is similar, the implementations acrosssites is often different which can lead to duplication of effort. Thispresentation will use the above challenges as motivation for introducing a new,open-source HPC community (OpenHPC) that is focused on providing HPC-centricpackage builds for a variety of common building-blocks in an effort to minimizeduplication, implement integration testing to gain validation confidence, andprovide a platform to share configuration recipes from a variety of sites.</p>

SUMMARY:Modeling a Philosophical Inquiry: from MySQL to a graph database
DESCRIPTION: <p><a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/">Bruno Latour</a> wrote a book about philosophy (an inquiry into modes of existence). He decided that the <a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/252">paper book</a> was no place for the numerous footnotes, documentation or glossary, insteadgiving access to all this information surrounding the book through a <a href="http://modesofexistence.org/">web application</a> which would present itself as a reading companion.He also offered to the community of readers to submit their contributions to his inquiry by writing new documents to be added to the platform.The first version of our <a href="https://github.com/medialab/aime-core">web application</a> was built on PHP Yiii and MySQL on the server side. This soon proved to be a nightmare to maintain because of the ultra-relational nature of our data.We refactored it completely to use node.js and Neo4J. We went from a tree system with internal links modelized inside a relational database to a graph of paragraphs included into documents, subchapters etc. all sharing links between them.On the way, we've learned Neo4J thoroughly, from graph data modeling to cypher tricks and developped our custom cypher query graphical monitor using sigma.js in order to check our data trans-modeling consistency.</p><p>During this journey, we've stumbled upon data model questions : ordered links, sub items grouping necessity, data output constraints from Neo4J, and finally the limitations of Neo4J community edition.Finally we feel much more confortable as developers in our new system. Reasoning about our data has become much easier and, moreover, our users are also happier since the platform's performance has never been better.</p><p>Our intention is, therefore, to share our experience with the community:</p><pre><code>- our application's data needs- our shift from a MySQL data model to a Neo4J graph model- our feedbacks in using a graph database and more precisely Neo4J including our custom admin tool [Agent Smith](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/agent-smith)- a very quick description of the admin tools we built to let the researchers write or modify contents (a markdown web editor)</code></pre><p>The research has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) / erc Grant ‘IDEAS’ 2010 n° 269567”</p>

But filesystem aging can not be avoided completely. This is true for all filesystems: ext4,xfs,btrfs,zfs,logfs,etc.This becomes a very serious problem for container/cloud solutions because most solutions use thin-provision storage.This talk overview existing techniques, our experience and new tools we develop for OpenVZ project</p>

SUMMARY:Tizen 3.0 platform security model
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most important design goal of Tizen 3.0 security framework is to separate applications from user private data and from fragile parts of the operating system. Another important aspect is security policy that is easy to configure. To meet these requirements, we combined usage of widely known DAC and one of the most simple Linux Security Modules - Smack. The talk will also cover set of tools used to control access to abstract resources (Cynara) and tools used to configure all needed policy mechanisms (Security-Manager). Finally, a new module for controlling multi-container virtual environments will be presented (Vasum), that is also part of the Tizen 3.0 security framework. Described security model is open source with repositories publicly available both on tizen.org and github. It is successfully implemented and used on Tizen 3.0 platform with increasing interest from other Linux distributions.</p>

SUMMARY:Ruby and OMR
DESCRIPTION: <p>Every language community implements many of the same core components like garbage collection, just-in-time compilation, threading, tooling support, etc. Wouldn't it be great if there was an open source community making these technologies available to be used in all languages? This is exactly the goal of the OMR project: an open source project with reusable runtime technologies originating from the IBM J9  JVM representing hundreds of developer years of investment.</p><p>This talk describes a set of experiments conducted by IBM to test the use of several OMR technologies within the Ruby MRI runtime: GC, JIT, method profiling, and more. All this while still running real Ruby applications, including Rails. The talk will include the results from our experiments and ideas about the future of Ruby and OMR.</p>

SUMMARY:Knot DNS Resolver
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Knot DNS Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation written in C and LuaJIT, including both a resolver library and a daemon. Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and efficient, and provides a state-machine like API for extensions. There are three built-in modules - iterator, cache, validator, and many external.</p><p>The Lua modules, switchable and shareable cache, and fast FFI bindings makes it great to tap into resolution process, or be used for your recursive DNS service. It's the OpenResty of DNS.</p><p>The server adopts a different scaling strategy than the rest of the DNS recursors - no threading, shared-nothing architecture (except MVCC cache that may be shared). You can start and stop additional nodes depending on the contention without downtime.</p>

SUMMARY:XALT: Tracking User Jobs and Environments on a Supercomputer
DESCRIPTION: <p>Let's talk real, no-kiddin' supercomputer analytics, aimed at movingbeyond monitoring the machine as a whole or even its individualhardware components. We're interested in drilling down to the level ofindividual tasks, users, and binaries. We’re after readyanswers to the "what, where, how, when and why" that stakeholders areclamoring for: everything from which libraries (or individualfunctions!) are in demand, to preventing the problems that get in theway of successful science. This talk will show how XALT can providethis type of job-level insight.</p>

SUMMARY:NemoTablet, a FOSS DIY tablet using Raspberry Pi 2
DESCRIPTION: <p>Nemo Mobile is a long time FOSS operating system. Created in 2012 as continuation to Meego Community Edition, it has been actively developed since then. The newest iteration of it is to use Glacier UI as its renewed User Interface, along with its Qt Components. These components are now used in the NemoTablet adaptation, which I will present in this talk, using Raspberry Pi2 as underlying hardware and its plethora of possible peripherals to create a true DIY tablet.</p>

SUMMARY:Developing eco-conscious Libre Hardware
DESCRIPTION: <p>About 5 years ago it hit me that Corporations are never going to take responsibility for Software Libre compliance.  Full Software Libre compliance actually affects their bottom line, and it's the responsibility of Directors to pathologically maximise profits.  In fact, selling eco-conscious products that can be upgraded year-on-year, throwing away perfectly good components in the process, also adversely affects a Corporation's bottom line.</p><p>Competing with existing profit-maximising Corporations on "Software Libre Compliance" is not a strong selling point: nobody who isn't a programmer actually really cares, and they're not knowledgeable enough to upgrade the software anyway - they'd rather just throw the whole thing away and get a new one, in the naive hope that the new OS will somehow be better, cleaner, and free from the malware attacks that slowed down the perfectly good hardware they just discarded into landfill.</p><p>People are mainly influenced by money (saving it), cool-factor, convenience and fear. So the trick is to come up with a strategy that plays on all these four things.  The EOMA68 Project thus was envisioned as a way to help people save money (because they can upgrade just like popping out a "Memory Card", they can now push a button and pop out the "Computer Card"), as well as help reassure them on personal security.  Sending the laptop back for repair, you don't want the people in the shop to copy or rifle through your private data?  No problem: pop out the "Computer Card" before sending it off... and incidentally you can pop that Computer Card into a spare base unit and carry on working.</p><p>Almost as an incidental side-line, then, the products being developed are Software Libre Compliant right from the ground up (not that the end-users really need to know that, as it's not a major selling-point to them).  Some of the products being developed can even be RYF Certified (are FSF-Endorseable) - again, the average end-user doesn't care about this.  However, Software Libre developers will know what's under the hood, and are being invited to participate in bringing these products to market.  The first main products will be two EOMA68-compliant CPU Cards (one with an FSF-Endorseable Ingenic jz4775, the other with an Allwinner A20 dual-core ARM Cortex A7), a Micro-Desktop "base" and a 15.6in 1366x768 Laptop.  The laptop's case is 3D-printable on a standard 200x200mm Mendel90, and uses bamboo laminate for the main panels, to save on plastic.</p><p>In short: where standard Hardware Corporations are set on maximising profits year after year, collectively they've left a gaping hole in the market that, with a little creative thinking, can be filled by someone who is willing to take active responsibility for doing things in a conscientious and principled way.  The resultant products - which have an expected upgrade lifecycle of at least a decade - just happen to be really cool.</p>

SUMMARY:Back to the future
DESCRIPTION: <p>One of the best thing, that could have happened to LibreOffice is the development its online version.</p><p>We can edit typographic quality documents in a browser using arbitrary page layout with page styles, headers and footers, footnotes, linked frames, custom fonts, also with font features, like true small capitals and ligatures.</p><p>These WYSIWYG document editing and form filling capabilities aren't limited by incomplete web standards and clients, and they are based on the OpenDocument format and its embedded XML based form standard, XForms.</p><p>We have made minor, but important LibreOffice improvements, too, like changing the default, unprofessional ASCII apostrophe to the long-awaited typographic one (U+2019) in online and desktop versions of LibreOffice.</p><p>To solve the problem of the simplified toolbars of the online version, we allowed to use nearly all keyboard shortcuts of LibreOffice in the online version, also adding new ones for compatibility and better usage, for example the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-F for footnote insertion.</p><p>The presentation will show several online document editing examples, focusing on the typographic quality and easy layout management (like online usage of the OpenDocument character, paragraph, list, page and other styles, the strengths of Writer word processor), and the related developments.</p>

SUMMARY:MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine 
DESCRIPTION: <p>The MariaDB CONNECT storage engine now offers access to JSON file and allows you to see a external JSON file as a MariaDB table. The CONNECT storage Engine has the capability to auto discover a table structure when the table correspond to external data.The MariaDB CONNECT storage engine comes with a set of UDFs (user defined functions) to manipulate the JSON format. This JSON content can be stored in a normal text column. This approach can be used as a way to implement dynamic columns.Beside JSON the MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine allows to access various file formats (CSV, XML, JSON, Excel, etc). It also gives access to any ODBC data sources (Oracle, DB2, SQLServer, etc).These various capabilities of foreign datasources access makes it a perfect tool for data integration.</p>

SUMMARY:From Regular Expressions to Parsing JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: <p>We'll start by demystifying Perl 6 regular expressions with some help from Perl5. From there we'll name the blocks that we've captured along the way, and refactor our regular expressions into Perl 6 rules and tokens. Those rules and tokens will combine to form a full Perl 6 grammar, and actions let us generate an abstract syntax tree directly from a bunch of little regular expressions.</p>

SUMMARY:Haxe : A language by gamedevs for gamedevs
DESCRIPTION: <p>These last years, game development have changed a lot, the proliferation of tools have made game creation way easier than before. Gamedev learning tools like Construct and Stencyl have made game development ubiquituous. But even if creating a simple game is no longer a challenge. These days there are so many options fo create your own games, even your own game engine. Then comes a big problem. Unplanned obsolescence. Every game engine dies. Every game engine that has its own crazy, crappy script variant, has its own API, its own tremors. And when it dies you might usually lose your rendering code, your shader infrastructure, your gameplay routines or your business logic.</p><p>Haxe tries to solve all these problems. It is not an engine, nor a framework. It is a language and a toolkit. Haxe compiles your code to every major languages used for game developments. Haxe pre-optimizes your code so that you focus on your game. Haxe does native compilation and allow you to bypass VM's. With its advanced type system and aggresive inlining, it can even allow jitted code to go faster than hand written code.</p><p>Whether you use Unity3D, Flash, Unreal, Haxe can bring you goodness and agility.</p><p>So let's talk about OSS and Haxe a bit!</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>It is generally accepted that, even where a FOSS license is silent on patents, there is an implied patent license granted. The theory under US law is equitable estoppel, legal estoppel, or both. A license implied by equitable estoppel is one based on conduct, and a license implied by legal estoppel is based on the principle that one may not license a right, in the case of FOSS licenses the copyright, and then derogate from the right granted by asserting a different right.</p><p>The session will briefly cover the concepts of equitable estoppel and legal estoppel and argue that, while both trademarks and patents may be impliedly licensed by equitable estoppel, and patents are always licensed under a theory of legal estoppel, trademarks (qua trademark, not the pure letter string) will never be impliedly licensed under the doctrine of legal estoppel because enforcing trademark rights does not derogate from the copyright grant, i.e., the right to run, study, adapt, redistribute and improve the program.</p>

SUMMARY:The CentOS CI: A getting started guide
DESCRIPTION: <p>The CentOS CI is a public resource that open source based projects canuse for integration tests on bare metal hardware. The goal of theproject is to be a resource for communities that build on top of CentOSin order to enable them to perform better automated testing. Down theline this infrastructure will be developed into a full pipeline for buildingand testing containers. This talk will give an overview of the CentOS CIas well as a quick start to getting started with the project.</p>

SUMMARY:Tools that helped to build HelenOS
DESCRIPTION: <p>HelenOS could not have been developed without certain tools such as compilers, interpreters and emulators. In many cases, these tools have been evolving or leaving their age of infancy at the same time as HelenOS. The long exposure to these tools gave us invaluable experience regarding their strengths and weaknesses. In this talk, I would like to share some of it.</p>

SUMMARY:Emulating the Nintendo 3DS
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Nintendo 3DS, released in 2011, remains the most popular current-generation handheld game console today. Featuring a complete hardware redesign compared to its predecessors the DS and the DSi, it hasn't been target of any emulator project for a while. In 2014, we released the open-source project Citra as the first public 3DS emulator. Originally only capable of running simple homebrew applications, Citra has gone a long way since then - now being able to run many commercial games with reasonably fine renderings, and steadily adding support for new titles.</p><p>This talk will focus on the 3DS hardware design and software stack, Citra's approach on emulating it, and the issues and challenges encountered during development.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>The upcoming Ubuntu Personal is a secure system for converged desktop, laptop, and mobile devices, with transaction updates and apps with bundled dependencies.  Problem is, the old stuff we may depend on to do our day-to-day work may not be immediately available to run natively.

DESCRIPTION: <p>Whether you are building a Robot, controlling a Radar, or creating a Web App, the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC) can help you. The stats exposed by the Garbage Collector since Ruby v2.1 caught my attention and pushed me to dig deeper. Both Ruby 2.1 and 2.2 brought great performance improvements. From a practical point of view, we will discuss how to use the GC to enhance significantly the performance of your software, from configuration parameters to different approaches on how you can change them yourself.</p>

SUMMARY:IXA pipes: Easy and ready use NLP tools for language communities
DESCRIPTION: <p>IXA pipes (http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes/) is a modular set of Natural Language Processing tools (or pipes) which provide easy access to NLP technology for several languages. It offers robust and efficient linguistic annotation to both researchers and non-NLP experts with the aim of lowering the barriers of using NLP technology either for research purposes or for small industrial developers and SMEs. The ixa pipes can be used or exploit its modularity to pick and change different components.  Every ixa pipe can be up an running after two simple steps. The tools require Java 1.7+ to run and are designed to come with all batteries included, which means that it is not required to do any system configuration or install any third-party dependencies. The modules will run on any platform as long as a JVM 1.7+ is available.</p><p>IXA pipes are just a set of processes chained by their standard streams, in a way that the output of each process feeds directly as input to the next one. The Unix pipes metaphor has been applied for NLP tools by adopting a very simple and well known data centric architecture, in which every module/pipe is interchangeable by any other tool as long as it reads and writes the required data format via the standard streams.</p><p>The data format in which both the input and output of the modules needs to be formatted to represent and pipe linguistic annotations is NAF. We currently covered tokenization, pos tagging, lemmatization, Named Entity Recognition and classification and probabilistic parsing, but further annotations and languages can be easily added. The tools are distributed under Apache License 2.0.</p>

SUMMARY:Plugins and Go
DESCRIPTION: <p>Go doesn't have native ability to create and use plugins during runtime. As of Go1.5, there are 2 ways of doing plugins.1. Using inter-process communication and stand alone programs.2. Using a scripting language and an embedded VM.</p><p>I'll be discussing the pros and cons of each, and discuss how to implement both approaches.</p>

SUMMARY:What Do Code Reviews at Microsoft and in Open Source Projects Have in Common?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Code review is the manual assessment of source code by human reviewers. It is widely recommended practice in software engineering and it is widely adopted both in industrial settings and in open source projects.What can we learn if we compare code review in OSS projects and at Microsoft? In this talk, I will present and compare the results of two studies about code review: One conducted at Microsoft and one conducted in open source settings. We learn that--despite the differences in environments, incentives, languages, and used tools--code review at Microsoft and in the analyzed open source projects have one common trait: The outcome. Unfortunately, this outcome does not match the main reasons why developers say they do code reviews: Finding defects. I will discuss why this happens and what we can do about it.</p>

SUMMARY:How to Migrate Anything with DDD
DESCRIPTION: <p>Several migration frameworks and libraries have been created over the years in order to help developers manage their data and schemas changes in a reliable, collaborative manner. But even well-adopted solutions like Phinx and Doctrine Migrations have either struggled to keep-up with modern PHP due to architectural issues, or failed to provide enough framework integration to be actually practical for everyday use.</p><p>This talk will guide you through the process of re-designing and implementing the very core of the migration mechanism into a "domain library" that can be re-used to power migrations for virtually any modern PHP framework (not kidding!). But most importantly, throughout the process you will experience first-hand why having a DDD mindset can help you invent and contribute relevant modules to the open-source community.</p>

SUMMARY:Clearwater: Open-Source IMS Core for the Cloud
DESCRIPTION: <p>Clearwater is designed from the ground up to run in the cloud providing voice, video and messaging services to millions of users, using from the software design principles of the Web – such as horizontal scalability, NoSQL and, statelessness – and building on those to provide the robustness and standards compliance expected of an IMS core at the centre of a telco-grade communications network. Its software-only approach and simple configuration makes it extremely well suited for deployment in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment. It has already been used as an exemplar VNF (virtual network function) by CloudNFV, Cloudify, OPNFV and Canonical, and deployed live as the backbone of the Indoona VoIP service in Italy, and other major service providers.</p><p>This talk covers the key aspects of Clearwater – what an IMS core is and how it fits into a telecommunications network, how Clearwater differs from traditional telecoms appliances, what architectural principles have been followed in building it, how open source has contributed. It will also describe the  work we’ve done to make Clearwater easy to integrate with NFV orchestrators – from the DevOps installation approach, to an etcd-based automatic clustering manager.</p>

SUMMARY:How to design a Linux kernel API
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Linux kernel-user-space API is littered with design errors: APIs that are non-extensibe, unmaintainable, overly complex, limited-purpose, violations of standards, and inconsistent. Most of those mistakes can't be fixed because doing so would break the ABI that the kernel presents to user-space binaries. To further rub salt into the wound, kernel-user-space APIs are often buggy when first shipped. Thus, it's important to get API designs right the first time. Taking (good and bad) examples from past APIs, I'll cover a number ideas on improving the design of future kernel user-space APIs. Those tips are relevant both for kernel developers producing the APIs and for user-space programmers looking at what kernel developers are serving to them. I'll also look at some strategies that developers can pursue in order to get help with improving the designs of APIs that they are producing.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>In the MACH project, we are working on transparent compilation toolchain for heterogeneous targets (CPUs, GPUs, ManyCores). Starting from the R language, we have built a higher level intermediate representation on top of the LLVM-IR, to benefit from a well defined target for the front-end generation and to reuse the LLVM optimization passes framework over that IR. The compiler generates LLVM-IR proper, integrated with a dataflow oriented, heterogeneous capable high performance runtime (StarPU). This talk will describe the higher-level IR and how the required transformations were implemented as LLVM passes.</p>

SUMMARY:Clusternaut: Orchestrating Percona XtraDB Cluster with Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk is about orchestrating Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) nodes atop Google Container Engine (GCE) with Kubernetes. PXC provides for synchronous replication among MySQL nodes through the WSREP (writeset replication) API, and Galera plugin which implements it, to provide group communication and configuration through extended virtual synchrony (EVS). While it can be run in isolation, GCE provides other architectural elements such as fluentd for logging, etcd for co-ordination, skydns for DNS among others, which are vital in this design.</p>

SUMMARY:Evaluating OpenStack Containers as a service Magnum for production
DESCRIPTION: <p>There are lots of new OpenStack services being developed and the hottest ones is the containers as a service Magnum. The project is so new that it's not even in the Project Navigator http://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator but it has been at the center stage at the past two OpenStack Summits. In this talk we'll answer to questions like: What is Magnum, what services does it offer, why is it important and why is a large operator looking into deploying it in production?</p>

SUMMARY:Peer to Peer Realtime with Blockchains
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most realtime collaborative editors make use of a class of algorithms known as Operational Transformation. Most of these algorithms require that the server and the client run the same algorithm otherwise risk desynchronisation - the nightmare of realtime collaboration algorithm designers. I will propose a new method of finding consensus using a blockchain of the type originated in bitcoin. This algorithm uses the blockchain to find consensus on the state of the collaborative document or data-structure then applies the Operational Transformation on the client side without requiring any help from the server. Such a setup simplifies the server side, allowing multiple implementations of the server, for example in different programming languages, but it also allows the client-side to use encryption in order to keep the data secret from the server. Finally, I will propose an extension to this algorithm which, borrowing again from bitcoin, makes the system able to function purely as a peer-to-peer system, providing high resilience and greater security.</p>

SUMMARY:Open-Source Neuroheadset Brain-Duino
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the recent years, affordable Brain-Computer Interfaces are becoming more accessible for consumers. Applications range from controlling computers / machines, biofeedback and Quantified Self. At first sight, the current generation of commercial devices seem to be decent in their functionality, and various use cases are suggested. However, neurophysiological signal quality, as well as limitations of software and hardware hackability are among the greatest issues and hurdles towards advancement in user experience. This is why we started to work on Brain-Duino, an open-source brainwave amplifier shield for the Arduino and other microcontrollers.</p>

SUMMARY:Introduction to IoT.js
DESCRIPTION: <p>IoT.js is a platform for IoT applications written in JavaScript. With IoT.js developers can create IoT services that communicate with each other and the outside world.IoT.js is a lightweight version of Node.js and designed to bring the success of Node.js to small IoT devices like lamps, thermometers, switches and sensors. This class of devices tends to use resource-constrained microcontrollers which are too small to fit a full Node.js stack.In order to meet those constraints, IoT.js runs on top of JerryScript which is a lightweight JavaScript engine running on platforms with less than 64KB of RAM and less than 200KB of flash memory. Despite the low footprint, JerryScript is a full-featured JavaScript engine implementing the entire ECMAScript 5.1 standard.Both IoT.js and JerryScript are open source projects released under the Apache License.The talk will include a demo running a Node.js module with IoT.js on a resource-constrained microcontroller.</p>

SUMMARY:Automated tracking of performance of compiler-generated code.
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ensuring that top-of-trunk consistently generates high-quality coderemains harder than it should be. Continuous integration (CI) setupsthat track correctness of top-of-trunk work pretty well today sincethey automatically report correctness regressions with low falsepositive rate to committers. In comparison, the output generated by CIsetups that track performance require far more human effort tointerpret.</p><p>In this talk, I’ll describe why I think effective performance trackingis hard and what problems need solving, with a focus on our real worldexperiences and observations.</p><p>As part of the bring-up of one of the public performance trackingbots, I’ve done an in-depth analysis of its performance and noisecharacteristics. The insights gained from this analysis drove a numberof improvements to LNT and the test-suite in the past year. I hopethat sharing these insights will help others in setting up low-noiseperformance-tracking bots.</p><p>I’ll conclude by summarizing what seem to be the most importantmissing pieces of CI functionality to make the performance-trackinginfrastructure as effective as the correctness-trackinginfrastructure.</p><p>This presentation has been given before at the US LLVM dev meetingin San Jose. Given the interest there and the mostly non-overlappingaudience between the FOSDEM llvm dev room and the US dev meeting, Ithink it's worthwhile to repeat this presentation at FOSDEM.</p>

SUMMARY:Introduction to MySQL GIS
DESCRIPTION: <p>What is an SRID, and why should I care? Does MySQL care? The answers to these questions and more will be given in this talk as we give a quick introduction to GIS in general and in MySQL in particular. MySQL 5.7 gave GIS a real boost, and more is to be expected in the future. If you're not using it yet, it's time to get started!</p><p>This crash course covers data types, import, export, indexing, operations on GIS data, caveats and how to prepare for the future of more and better GIS in MySQL. If you've never used GIS before and are curious to learn, or if you already know GIS and want to know how MySQL supports it, this talk is for you.</p>

SUMMARY:Lessons learned running SSL at scale
DESCRIPTION: <p>Several years ago, Facebook launched an internal initiative to integrate more encryption into its corporate infrastructure. The effort required advanced, yet highly responsive solutions in multiple areas, including vulnerability management, secure key distribution, and support for dated encryption in markets where modern encryption is still not viable. This technical talk will outline how Facebook has implemented some of these systems and provide recommendations for methodologies and open-source tools that could allow other organizations to put them into practice. It will also discuss how Facebook is addressing the challenge of serving SSL to millions of people in developing countries.</p>

SUMMARY:Comparing codes of conduct to copyleft licenses
DESCRIPTION: <p>The GPL restricts freedom to redistribute, for some developers, to preserve and expand freedom for all users, including developers. This is a tradeoff we free software aficionados accept. What other tradeoffs around freedom are we accepting, when it comes to user experience (including developer experience), codes of conduct, and our financial structures? When we compare those policies and assumptions to licenses like the GPL, we learn unexpected lessons about our attitudes towards governance, and we consider where our decisions place us on the liberty-to-hospitality spectrum.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Hero.Coli is a single-player 2D top-down adventure game where the player controls a bacterium to explore a fantasy aquatic world. The user directs this bacterium, a stylized Escherichia coli, to collect and combine functional DNA fragments in order to engineer and control its abilities. More precisely, the user can craft and equip genetic devices, including one that enables the bacterium to increase its speed, and another genetic device that makes the bacterium blink. Again, the functionalities obtained by the bacterium in the game mimic real genetic circuits with similar functions.</p>

SUMMARY:Experiences with OpenDaylight Service Function Chaining (SFC)
DESCRIPTION: <p>SURFnet is the national research network in the Netherlands. We offer         <br/>(internet) services to the Dutch higher education and research community.     <br/>Our goal was to get hands on experience with Network Function Virtualisation  <br/>(NFV) using open source software. We choose to use the OpenDaylight Service   <br/>Function Chaining (SFC) software.</p><p>In this presentation I will give a short introduction of NFV and the          <br/>concepts used in SFC followed by how we used these in a 4K streaming          <br/>proof of concept (poc). The network functions is the poc were video           <br/>transcoding functions like grayscaling, adding a logo or text, and            <br/>mirroring along the Y or X axis.  During the development of this              <br/>poc we ran into several problems and limitations of both hardware             <br/>and software. I will explain the multi table limitations of our               <br/>ASIC based OpenFlow switches and the challenges with MAC and IP               <br/>address handling in OpenStack VMs.</p><p>Ronald van der Pol joined SURFnet in 2012 where he scouts and                 <br/>evaluates new network technologies. His current focus is on SDN,              <br/>NFV, programmable dataplanes (OpenFlow and P4), multipathing, and             <br/>end-to-end performance of demanding applications. He holds masters            <br/>degrees in both Physics and Computer Science.</p>

SUMMARY:Going beyond the CPython C API
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk, we will see an intro and status of two projects: PyPy, an alternative Python-in-Python implementation; and CFFI, an alternative to using the standard C API to extend Python.  These two projects are very different, but CFFI is a possible solution to a problem that hits notably PyPy --- the CPython C API.</p><p>The CPython C API was great and contributed to the present-day success of Python, together with tools built on top of it like Cython and SWIG.  I will argue that it may be time to look beyond it.</p>

SUMMARY:Jenkins as a Code
DESCRIPTION: <p>Jobs in Jenkins (or any other CI/CD tool) can be created and updated manually using GUI. It is ok if you have a few/several of them. However, most of the companies grow and you can quickly wake up with dozens or hundreds of jobs to maintain.</p><p>A new email address/alias to get notification about failed builds? Global migration to the better™ SCM? No way to do it manually with GUI in a convenient way. It just doesn’t scale. Manual scripts using Jenkins API? Better, but hard to test and maintain. The same applies to plugin installation, credentials managements etc. Luckily, there is a better way.</p><p>During the talk we will present how Jenkins Job DSL together with Ansible can be used to automatically provision Jenkins instance and maintain any number of jobs. We will show how to define jobs and views in Groovy based DSL and test automatically that the generated structures are exactly the same as expected in Jenkins. Expect live demo - we will setup fully functional Jenkins instance with just one click!</p>

It is therefore challenging to make sure the different services are able to act properly, rather than become overloaded with incoming data. "Reactive" concepts can help overcome such challenges. In this presentation I'll show how oVirt embraced these concepts and evolved to Reactive architecture, and show the impact it had on overall system performance and stability.</p>

SUMMARY:Hurd, Rump kernel, sound, and usb
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Hurd recently saw some experimental work to add sound support. This was done thanks to the Rump kernel, embedded in a library. As a first-working implementation the library is directly linked into mplayer, but of course we plan to make this much more flexible by moving the Rump sound driver into a separate translator, very much like we did for network drivers with netdde. This however poses design questions. The other hardware bit missing on the Hurd is USB support, which we should be able to add a similar way. This poses yet more design questions, as to the shape of the hird of translators we should start for this. This will of course also be the opportunity to give the now-traditional yearly latest news about the Hurd.</p>

SUMMARY:Managing Spatio-Temporal Big Data through Scalable OGC Web Services
DESCRIPTION: <p>In geosciences, and especially in the fields of remote sensing and geomatics, frequently large amounts of raster data need to be stored and processed efficiently. Rasdaman is tackling the big data deluge by providing a scalable array database that is capable of storing complex geographic data structures and exposing them through open and standard web services. Actually, the rasdaman team is actively shaping the OGC Big Geo Data standards.</p><p>Rasdaman is the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Core Reference Implementation, but also supports WMS and WPS, for example. A particularly exciting extension of the WCS service is the Processing Extension. This links in the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) which allows users to exploit the flexibility of a fully fledged query language for coverages to request ad-hoc parallel processing directly on the server, minimizing data transfer and response times.</p>

SUMMARY:Rethinking Extension Development for PHP and HHVM
DESCRIPTION: <p>When MongoDB and its PHP driver first appeared on the scene, the GoPHP5 movement was just winding down, PHP6 books were on the best-seller list, and developers were handling dependencies with a mix of PEAR and Git submodules. After six years, our beloved driver had become quite the complex, monolithic extension, and PHP 5.x was no longer the only platform on the block. With the goal of supporting multiple platforms (PHP 5.x, HHVM, and PHP 7) while still keeping our maintenance burden in check, we set out to create several new light-weight extensions and pushed all of those user-friendly, high-level APIs off to a single, supporting PHP library. This session will walk through our journey and provide a fresh look at the next-generation MongoDB driver for PHP.</p>

SUMMARY:Avoid the maze of container networking
DESCRIPTION: <p>Containerized applications had been the biggest driver for a number of SDN projects which came to life in the last year. There are several challenges that highly-dynamic and fully-distributed container orchestration systems impose on SDN architectures.</p><p>This presentation is geared towards anyone working with open source SDN technologies, as well as those who would like to ensure the robustness of their containers' connections / of their container connectivity.</p><p>Several approaches/options for container networking will be presented, including Weave Net, an open source overlay network for Docker containers. We will demonstrate the in-kernel Open vSwitch datapath used in Weave Net; this manages VXLAN tunnel configuration across hosts, without requiring the user to be a networking expert. We will also highlight how Weave Net provides service discovery and load balancing through a robust, distributed DNS. Users don't need to understand the underlying complexity, nor do they need to make changes to their application.</p><p>In this talk, Weave Net's engineers will share what is required to deliver this level of user experience, through the implementation decisions they have made.</p>

SUMMARY:UPSERT use cases
DESCRIPTION: <p>PostgreSQL 9.5 will have support for a feature that is popularly known as "UPSERT" - the ability to either insert or update a row according to whether an existing row with the same key exists. If such a row already exists, the implementation should update it. If not, a new row should be inserted. This is supported by way of a new high level syntax (a clause that extends the INSERT statement) that more or less relieves the application developer from having to give any thought to race conditions. This common operation for client applications is set to become far simpler and far less error-prone than legacy ad-hoc approaches to UPSERT involving subtransactions. Moreover, the new implementation performs much better than those legacy approaches.</p><p>While the feature is most obviously compelling for OLTP and web application use cases, it's also true that the syntax is powerful enough to be very useful in many real world data integration scenarios. The non-standard PostgreSQL syntax offer explicit, fine grained control over where and how to update. For example, an update may not actually affect an existing row due to not satisfying some additional criteria (i.e. due to not passing the ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE special, dedicated WHERE clause).</p><p>This talk gives an overview of the feature from a high level, and examines these use cases. You will learn how you might want to use the new UPSERT feature in your application beyond the obvious. In passing, there will be brief discussion of why UPSERT's implementation proved to be a hard problem, and, relatedly, why a custom syntax was used instead of the SQL standard's MERGE syntax.</p>

SUMMARY:Leveraging Docker in Automotive projects based on AGL/GENIVI
DESCRIPTION: <p>Light virtualisation is often viewed as a security mechanism providing isolation on a production device or as a quick deployment tool for Cloud services. But it can also be used in automotive projects as a tool to ease the development phase.This talk focuses on Docker benefits for the whole development cycle of an automotive project: it can increase build speeds and allows easier sharing of common snapshots between developers. Platform and application developments can also benefit from containers at various stages. Long term support is equally made easier.</p>

SUMMARY:Integrate spell and grammar checking
DESCRIPTION: <p>Free and open source software deals with many kinds of data, including written text. Authors of all levels are prone to making spelling or grammatical mistakes when editing content. The challenge is to offer feedback directly to a writer, during the content creation process, in order to fix errors immediately. Simultaneously, his or her writing skills improve accordingly. Several FOSS writing tools are currently available with a myriad of language bindings, librares and APIs. This lightning talk will introduce software developers to best practises, help avoiding pitfalls, give a glance of the future and put a smile on your face.</p>

SUMMARY:Live Migration of Virtual Machines From the Bottom Up
DESCRIPTION: <p>Hypervisors get deployed in wildly different scenarios: datacenters are different from clouds, and both of these are different from the way we use virtualization on our workstations or laptops.  This has resulted in the different projects using a layered approach, which makes everything modular, but prone to a lot of mismatches and errors.  Effort has been ongoing on making these layers behave as a cohesive whole, while addressing the usecases and demands from the various deployment scenarios in a way that scales well.  This talk will be focussed on the live migration aspect of virtualization, showcasing some of the usecases, and actual problems that have been solved while keeping all the usecases in mind.</p>

SUMMARY:The Unix history in a repository
DESCRIPTION: <p>The evolution of the Unix operating system is made available as a version-control repository, covering the period from its inception in 1972 as a five thousand line kernel, to 2015 as a widely-used 26 million line system.  The repository contains 659 thousand commits and 2306 merges.  The repository employs the commonly used Git system for its storage, and is hosted on the popular GitHub archive.  It has been created by synthesizing with custom software 24 snapshots of systems developed at Bell Labs, Berkeley University, and the 386BSD team, two legacy repositories, and the modern repository of the open source FreeBSD system.  In total, 850 individual contributors are identified, the early ones through primary research.  The data set can be used for empirical research in software engineering, information systems, and software archaeology.  Community contributions to improve the included data and extend the covered systems are more than welcomed.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Usually IoT discussions focus either on the hardware for setting up the sensors and bridging devices or in the middleware for dealing with the data aggregation from the sensors. This misses the point that IoT is the realization of end-to-end machine interaction. In this talk I address this issue by showing how to approach IoT end-to-end using free software. We'll pick and choose from many projects out there, some of them apparently unrelated to more "traditional" IoT approaches are revealed to be fundamental for a scalable IoT implementation.</p>

SUMMARY:Sulong: Fast LLVM IR Execution on the JVM with Truffle and Graal
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk gives a hands-on technical overview of Sulong, a LLVM IR interpreter written in Java on top of the Truffle framework which will be released under a BSD 3-Clause License within the next few weeks.Sulong uses Graal as a JIT compiler which performs aggressive optimizations to reach native execution speeds.We will shortly explain the concepts of Truffle and Graal, to then focus on Sulong itself.</p><p>First, we will present how to get started hacking Sulong, and use the mx build tool of the Truffle/Graal ecosystem.We use the Truffle Domain Specific Language (DSL) to implement LLVM IR operations as AST nodes, and we will demonstrate how Graal optimizes and compiles the AST.Subsequently, we demonstrate how we implement speculative optimizations such as value profiling, profile based inlining, branch probability injection, inlining of function pointer calls, and other dynamic optimizations.</p><p>We show how Sulong uses the Java Unsafe API to access native memory and implement pointers. By using the Graal Foreign Native Interface Sulong can call native libraries directly from Java code. Virtual registers from LLVM bitcode are mapped to the Truffle Frame implementation which gets escape-analyzed and thus ensures fast access to local variables. We show how we map some of the common data types such as I32 directly to Java primitives, and how we map others such as the X86 80 bit floating point to custom Java types.</p><p>Finally, we give you an outline of the things we still want to implement in Sulong, and how other Truffle languages can use Sulong as their native interfaces, and perform function inlining and optimizations over language boundaries.We will also present how we want to use Truffle and the Java platform to implement security features such as efficient integer overflow value tagging and memory safety.</p>

SUMMARY:Infrastructure provisioning in context of organization
DESCRIPTION: <p>Nowadays companies/organizations migrate and operate their infrastructure in virtual infrastructures (Cloud/IaaS). To efficiently operate and adapt to everyday changes and requirements they need to leverage automation which will do not only configuration, but orchestration, backup/recovery, reporting and monitoring as well. All of the processes are related to organization and are used by people in the organization.Imagine a tool which is able to automate and simplify whole process around the IaaS.</p>

SUMMARY:Java with syslog-ng
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk I intend to demonstrate how we had integrated the Java virtual machine into a multi-threaded, pluginized C program. If you have ever encountered the problem that something only has Java API while you intend to use it with your C / C++ code, this talk is for you.</p><p>The goal of syslog-ng is to become a major player in the big data logging infrastructure market. Our aim is to be the fastest and most reliable logging software that can send messages to most big data tools, for example Elasticsearch, Hadoop and Kafka. Most big data software uses Java API. Originally, syslog-ng has been written in C, with the pros and cons of the language. Although there are a few 3rd party tools in C language, utilizing these results in encountering several problems, for example difficulties when we attempt to follow the original libraries, maintenance issues, and so on. Therefore, in order to stay up-to-date with the big data tools, we must use the official Java APIs. This is why we have started our “Java language binding” project. We also hope that this project will be an important factor in the syslog-ng community, because now anyone who wants to contribute to improving syslog-ng by developing plugins in Java can do so.</p>

SUMMARY:Where are your symbols, debuginfo and sources?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Users (and developers) don't just want to run an executable, they also like to know that it runs efficiently, that it doesn't use unnecessary resources and if it crashes and burns they want to collect the pieces and inspect what went wrong. So a package should also provide the user with a means to easily profile, trace and debug what is running on their system. This means a distro should also package symbols, debuginfo and sources for easy/automatic installation. With different distros and different versions of distro packages running next to each other in containers we need some standard conventions to identify executables (build-id) and match and fetch the needed symbols, debuginfo and sources to help the user profile, trace and debug any binary they find on their system.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>June, 2015: a NASCAR circuit in California hosts the biggest real size humanoid robot competition in history with 26 teams from all over the world. It was the Darpa Robotics Challenge. The goal of the contest was to push the limits in robotics to assisting humans in responding to natural and man-made disasters. Two years before, as the first part of the contest, took place the Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC) which consisted on replicate the same set of tasks proposed in challenge finals but using cloud-based robotic simulation instead of real robots.</p><p>The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), thanks to its open source robotics simulator Gazebo, was selected to rule this virtual contest. It was a challenge to manage the software infrastructure, from the simulator to machine provisioning, and testing played a key role. The talk will review the testing practices that were designed and implemented during the development of the software infrastructure used for the Virtual Robotics Challenge.</p><p>How was the testing of a robotics contest in the cloud done? What did we learn about testing software from organizing the VRC? How using open source software helped to organize the VRC?</p>

SUMMARY:C Code Refactoring
DESCRIPTION: <p>Despite its maturity and popularity, the C programming language still lacks tool support for reliably performing even simple refactoring, browsing, or analysis operations.  This is primarily due to identifier scope complications introduced by the C preprocessor.  The CScout refactoring browser analyses complete program families by tagging the original identifiers with their precise location and classifying them into equivalence classes orthogonal to the C language's namespace and scope extents.  A web-based user interface provides programmers with an intuitive source code analysis and navigation front-end, while an SQL-based backend allows more complex source code analysis and manipulation.  CScout has been successfully applied to many medium and large open source and proprietary projects identifying thousands of modest refactoring opportunities.  Projects where CScout has been applied include the Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris kernels, Apache httpd, awk, PostgreSQL, and gdb.</p>

SUMMARY:OSCAR: Address the new challenges of open-source software quality
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this lightning talk, we would like to share our experience, vision and methodology regarding today's challenge of improving the quality of open source software.With the increasing success of OSS software and in parallel the advent of OSS quality failures such as Heartbleed, the interest for the models and tools able to measure and improve the quality of open-source software is growing.This presentation will introduce:- the OSCAR model, a new quality model for assessing open-source software (OSCAR stands for Open-source Sofware Capability Assessment Round-up), sustained by the OW2 Consortium. We will explain how it differs from other models and we will present the model's status and roadmap.- the OSCAR platform, an open-source umbrella project implementing the OSCAR model by combining several open-source quality tools such as SonarQube, Fossology, ScanCode, Spago4Q, and outcomes from the RISCOSS European collaborative project. We will show how this platform is used for continously assessing the quality of the OW2 projects.</p>

SUMMARY:Gradoop: Scalable Graph Analytics with Apache Flink
DESCRIPTION: <p>At the Leipzig University, we develop Gradoop [1], a framework for distributed,declarative graph analytics on top of Apache Flink [2]. Gradoop is designedaround the so-called Extended Property Graph Model (EPGM) and supportssemantically rich, schema-free graph data. In this model, a database consistsof multiple property graphs, which we call logical graphs. These graphs areapplication specific subsets from shared vertex and edge sets. The EPGMprovides operators for both single graphs as well as collections of graphs.Operators may also return single graphs or graph collections thus enablingthe definition of analytical workflows in a declarative way.</p><p>In my talk, I would like to give an overview of Gradoop, the EPGM and itsoperators and show how Apache Flink helps us by presenting a subset of ouroperator implementations. Furthermore, I will sketch the usefulness of Gradoopby presenting an analytical use case from the business intelligence domain.</p><p>Gradoop is open-source and licenced under GPLv3. The Gradoop source code anda short documentation can be found on GitHub [3], a more detailed explanationof the data model and our operators can be found in a technical report [4].</p><p>[1] http://www.gradoop.com[2] http://flink.apache.org/[3] https://github.com/dbs-leipzig/gradoop[4] http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00548.pdf</p>

SUMMARY:Testing Webchat Stability
DESCRIPTION: <p>The stability of a webchat is dependent on numerous factors, ranging from quality of code and browser compatibility, to the stability of the infrastructure and the way it handles network instabilities. To make a sensible comparison between webchats or to measure changes in stability with a new version of a webchat, there needs to be some kind of standardized testing. In this talk I will show how I have set up an automated testing environment that automatically simulates numerous potential problems, including network instability.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>The USB Armory is an open source computer in the form of a USB stick. Itnormally runs Linux. But thanks to the ARM TrustZone capabilities of thedevice, it is possible to run the Genode OS Framework as microhypervisorbehind the back of Linux. This is useful for shielding sensitive informationlike cryptographic keys from Linux by exposing it to Genode only and therebydrastically reducing the attack surface. Even in the event Linux getscompromised, e.g., by a vulnerability in the USB stack, the secrets remainprotected.</p>

SUMMARY:Apache Flink: streaming done right
DESCRIPTION: <p>Data streaming is gaining popularity, as it offers decreased latency, a radically simplified data infrastructure architecture, and the ability to cope with new data that is generated continuously. Apache Flink is a full-featured stream processing framework with:</p><ul><li>Easy to use Java- and Scala-embedded APIs that make stream analytics easy, yet provide powerful tools to deal with time and uncertainty</li><li>Throughput of million of events per second per core</li><li>Latencies as low as the millisecond range</li><li>Exactly-once consistency guarantees, and the ability to realize distributed transactional data movement between systems (e.g., between Kafka and HDFS)</li><li>Ease of configuration and separation between application logic and fault tolerance via a novel asynchronous checkpointing algorithm</li><li>No single point of failure</li><li>Integration with popular open source infrastructure (e.g., Hadoop, HBase, Kafka, Cascading, Elasticsearch, …)</li><li>Support for event time and out of order arrivals with flexible windows, watermarks, and triggers</li><li>Batch processing as a special case of stream processing, including dedicated libraries for machine learning and graph processing, managed memory on-, and off-heap, and query optimization</li></ul><p>Flink is used in several companies, including at ResearchGate, Bouygues Telecom, the Otto Group, and Capital One, and has a large and active developer community of well over 140 contributors. In this talk, we provide an overview of the system and its streaming-first philosophy, as well as the project roadmap and vision: fully unifying the, now separate, worlds of “batch” and “streaming” analytics.</p>

SUMMARY:Copyleft For the Next Decade
DESCRIPTION: <p>Copyleft has faced serious challenges in the last five years. It's not over: many more threats are on the way. Not by coincidence these attacks on copyleft come when "Open Source" reaches new heights of success. For example, hordes of software developers are funded full time to churn out new Free Software, as long as it's not copylefted. Some such code is specifically designed to replace existing, widely used, copylefted programs.Meanwhile, programs under copyleft licenses (most notably the kernel named Linux) face a decades long, ongoing myriad of license violations. Such violations include nefarious attempts by major companies to shirk their responsibilities under copyleft. The situation is undoubtedly bleak.Those of us who care about software freedom need a plan. Copyleft once assured an equal playing field, but big companies work daily to tilt the playing field in their favor and against the interests of most developers, hobbyists, users, and enthusiasts.</p>

SUMMARY:Designer's compromises in Open Source
DESCRIPTION: <p>We might need a designer to provide a clear vision and solve everything we couldn't agree upon. Also the designer might expect to be warmly welcomed inside Open Source projects, but the reality can be a bit different. We always have expectations on how the designer - community interaction should be, but in order to have a successful collaboration we need compromises, sometimes from the designer's part, other times from the community members.</p>

SUMMARY:Baobáxia - the Galaxy of Baobab Trees
DESCRIPTION: <p>Baobáxia is a community-built project to connect about 200 Brazilian quilombos to assist the interchange and preservation of traditional, community-built culture.</p><p>A special challenge is found in the fact that many of these communities are located in remote areas with no access to the Internet. It is therefore imperative to be able to synchronize multimedia data offline.</p><p>Technically, the system uses git-annex to solve the challenging problem of offline distribution - but the really important part of the process is the community effort involved.</p>

We have implemented resumable batch software to complete this work.</p><p>This talk will be a playful, guided walk through Wikimedia's conversion, exploring how batch software for a complex system has been developed, debugged, and (repeatedly) troubleshooted.</p><p>Come hear about the batch architecture and the conversion process.  Topics will include performance issues with long-running batch jobs and the challenges of mapping between systems with different data models.   Plus, hear why a post about broken JavaScript broke our node.js service, what characters are (really) allowed in HTML 5 and XML, why "Ciudad de México" was the last page I converted in Mexico City, and more.</p>

SUMMARY:Wideband measurement strategies: from RADAR to passive wireless sensors
DESCRIPTION: <p>RADAR systems are instrinsically wideband devices, with a range resolution inversely proportional to the probe signal bandwidth. Recording wideband signals is a challenging task, with high data rates often yielding low resolution samples and hence poor range. Multiple strategies have been investigated to reduce the recording rate, including stroboscopy (assuming a static environment), downconversion or frequency stepped measurements, all of which are well suited to feed Software Defined Radio applications. In addition to monitoring passive reflectors, cooperative targets can be designed to reflect a signal whose delay is not representative of distance or velocity but a physical quantity. One early application of such an insight has been the bug placed by Russians in the American ambassador house, modulating an incoming continuous wave illumination signal to an amplitude modulated backscattered signal. Although the leaked NSA documents hint at such techniques still being used today, we will be interested in more daily applications in which sensors are designed to return a signal representative of an identifier (ID-tag) or a physical property.</p>

SUMMARY:Measure Twice, Code Once
DESCRIPTION: <p>The networking subsystems of any operating system have grown in complexity as the set of protocols and features supported has grown since the birth of the Internet. Firewalls, Virtual Private Networking, and IPv6 are just a few of the features present in the kernel that were not even envisioned when the original UNIX releases were developed over 30 years ago. Advances in networking hardware, with 10Gbps NIC cards being available for only a few hundred dollars, have far outstripped the speeds for which the kernel’s network software was originally written. As with the increasing speed of processors over the last 30 years, systems developers and integrators have always depended on the next generation of hardware to solve the current generation’s performance bottlenecks, often without resorting to any coherent form of measurement. This presentation shows developers and systems integrators at all proficiency levels how to benchmark networking systems, with specific examples. Common pitfalls are called out and addressed and a set of representative tests are given, all using open source software.</p>

SUMMARY:Increasing access to free and open knowledge for speakers of underserved languages on Wikipedia
DESCRIPTION: <p>One of the biggest barriers for accessing knowledge on the Internet is language. We tend to provide information in one or at most a few languages, which makes it hard for speakers of all the other languages to access that same information.This is also an issue on Wikipedia, a project widely and internationally used by all kind of people. But there are many topics that are only covered in few languages on Wikipedia. People who don’t speak any of these don’t have access to all the information available potentially vital to them.This is a huge issue we need to address.</p><p>Today we have Wikidata, Wikimedia’s knowledge base, which collects localized open structured data in one central place and makes it available to everyone.In this talk I will show you how we can give more people more access to more knowledge by making use of Wikipedia’s reach and Wikidata’s multilingual data.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>EPEL is a repository of packages rebuilt from the Fedora Project and available for use on RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and other *EL-based rebuilds. At FOSDEM 2015 there was a hallway session (literally), where we discussed the challenges of EPEL for users and developers, how to work best across the Fedora and CentOS projects, and how the repository should evolve. This session for FOSDEM 2016 intends to build on that discussion with a round-table of key people from EPEL, Fedora, and EL-rebuilds to discuss amongst themselves and with the audience what's right, what's wrong, how to fix, and what the future of EPEL should be.</p>

SUMMARY:F-Droid: building the private, unblockable app store
DESCRIPTION: <p>Mass surveillance and targeted attacks on mobile devices are getting easier and more common. A great number of mobile apps have been developed to assist users protect their privacy, but little has been done to address the issues facing distribution of the apps themselves. Basically all of the app stores except F-Droid track their users in detail.  Meanwhile, we are working to make F-Droid even more private. Google Play is blocked in many countries, and app stores like Play or iTunes often censor to comply with regional law, whether just or not. Regional app stores are often cesspools of malware. In many countries, people exchange apps through web forums, email, bluetooth, SD Cards, or any other method they can figure out, whether safe or not. Effective techniques for circumventing censorship and internet outages exist, and work in many places, but none work in all, and it is very difficult to keep track of them all. This current state requires users, trainers, developers, and organizations to be fluent in many technical details in order to effectively get and distribute mobile apps and media around the world.</p><p>In Cuba, people share apps via mesh networks and thumb drives. In Vietnam, swapping apps with Bluetooth is widespread. In China, the internet is ubiquitous but heavily filtered and monitored; but "collateral freedom" techniques have proven effective. Each of these workarounds can also be useful in many other parts of the world so F-Droid is including them all in a unified user experience. All of these distribution methods are included in F-Droid, and we are now working to provide a simple, smooth user experience, with three use cases in mind:</p><ul><li><p>The developer is in control of a simple set of commands that automate the entire distribution workflow for making highly secure, reproducible builds then getting them out through all possible channels.</p></li><li><p>Organizations and trainers can use these tools to make curated collections of apps and media use, without getting caught up in the technical details of the whole process.</p></li><li><p>The end user gets a familiar app store experience, regardless of the complexity behind their successful connectivity.</p></li></ul>

SUMMARY:Free Knowledge Game Jam: Bringing Two Worlds Together 
DESCRIPTION: <p>This year Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. partnered with the Computerspielemuseum Berlin and Cologne Game Lab to hold the first ever Free Knowledge Game Jam in Berlin in October 2015. A game jam is hackathon for games, where over the course of 24 hours, a game (or a prototype) should be developed. In our game jam we gave out a common theme: use one aspect of Free Knowledge in the game. The event was a great way to bring two worlds together - the world of Free Knowledge and Open Source software and the (often verycommercially-minded) game industry. This talk aims to introduce you to our concept of creating and promoting open source and free knowledge games via a game jam. Of course we will show you some of the creative games made during this event, too. Some games in-corporated open assets like graphics and sound. Some others used data or photos which are free to use via the Wikimedia APIs or repositories of Free Knowledge like Wikimedia Commons.</p>

SUMMARY:Benchmarking graph databases with gMark
DESCRIPTION: <p>Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains. Hence, graph database systems are becoming increasingly important. In the study of these systems, it is vital that the R&amp;D community has shared benchmarking solutions for the generation of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties. Similarly to TPC benchmarks for relational databases, benchmarks for graph databases have been important drivers for the Semantic Web and graph data management communities. Current benchmarks, however, are either limited to fixed graphs or graph schemas, or provide limited or no support for generating tailored query workloads to accompany graph instances.</p><p>To move the community forward, a benchmarking approach which overcomes these limitations is crucial. In this talk, we present the design and engineering principles of gMark, a domain- and query language-independent open-source graph benchmark addressing these limitations of current solutions. A core contribution of gMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generated graph instances and the generated query workloads coupled to these instances. A further novelty is the support of recursive regular path queries, a fundamental graph query paradigm. We illustrate the flexibility and practical usability of gMark by showcasing the framework's capabilities in generating high quality graphs and workloads, and its ability to encode user-defined schemas across a variety of application domains.</p><p>This is joint work with Guillaume Bagan, Angela Bonifati, Radu Ciucanu, Aurélien Lemay, and Nicky Advokaat.</p>

SUMMARY:Creating rich WebRTC applications with Kurento
DESCRIPTION: <p>WebRTC is a disruptive media technology bringing real-time multimedia communications to HTML5 standards. WebRTC is currently available for billions of users as a built-in feature of common browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. This makes possible the emergence of a truly open and interoperable technology competing with proprietary conferencing solutions and enabling developers to create specific-purpose WWW peer-to-peer real-time media applications in a simple and seamless manner.</p>

SUMMARY:Rearchitecting Linux I/O towards Petascale Storage
DESCRIPTION: <p>Linux kernel contains roughly 71 filesystems and a good portion of them exists solely to support legacy systems. User space storage is easier to implement, maintain and scale. Instead of resisting user space implementations of iSCSI, NFS and distributed filesystems, Linux kernel developers should embrace and standardize on FUSE and DPDK/SPDK like I/O architecture.</p>

SUMMARY:Guix-tox, a functional version of tox
DESCRIPTION: <p>Tox is a very well-known tool, written in Python, that allows users to run tests inside various virtual environments created using virtualenv. This approach prevents tests from being truly reproducible. We will see in this talk how virtualenv can be replaced by GNU Guix, a functional package manager, in order to improve tox. We will give real-life examples using Python packages from the OpenStack project.</p>

SUMMARY:How to run a telco on free software
DESCRIPTION: <p>Networks Functions Virtualizationm or NFV, is a very hot industry topic at the moment. What you might not know is what it means - telecommunications companies who have traditionally used only proprietary software to run their core services are now embracing free and open source software, and in the process changing the way they build and deploy core telco serives to be more open.</p><p>This presentation will review what makes up an NFV stack in OPNFV, covering OpenStack, OpenDaylight, Open vSwitch, DPDK, QEMU, the Linux kernel, and other projects. I will present the work being done in these communities to enable the migration of telco applications to this platform, particularly in the areas of improved network dataplane performance, enabling better management of applications running on the platform, and the ability to run real-time guest workloads with KVM.</p><p>I will also look at the organisational transformation in the telecommunications industry, and the adoption of DevOps and agile practices, and the evolving culture of the telecommunications industry, and how the changes that are happening at the request of the telecommunications industry benefit everyone, from the home hardware hacker hobbyist to IT operations in small and large companies.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>On today's supercomputers, chemists, biologists, physicists andengineers are sharing the same system and they all need differentsoftware. Environment Modules have been the way since the '90 thatusers select the software they need.  They allow users to load andunload the packages they want.  They get to control which version ofthe software they use, rather than the system administrators.  Lmod,implemented in Lua, is a modern replacement for the venerable TCL/Cbased tool. Lmod offers many features to handle the vastly moredynamic software environment than the original tool was designed tohandle.</p>

SUMMARY:Who controls your project? Governance in the real world
DESCRIPTION: <p>Many FOSS projects have a carefully designed governance. But to which extent that governance fits the real inner life of the project? In this talk I will present some ways of measuring to which extent governance may be subverted (or not) by real practices, how that can be detected, and tracked. From this base, I will show how a continuous tracking of those behaviors can contribute to a more fair development community, and to increase the trust in the project. The discussion will be framed by the concept of "open development analytics".</p>

SUMMARY:Putting 8 Million People on the Map:
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open source mapping tools are revolutionizing disaster preparedness and response around the world. After the Nepal Earthquake in 2015, more than 7000 contributors came together using open source tools such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's Tasking Manager to make more than 13 million edits to OpenStreetMap in the first two weeks after the earthquake. These tools are also empowering communities and international NGOs such as the American Red Cross and Medicins Sans Frontiers to map vulnerable areas before disasters occur. Using the power of the crowd, over 4000 "Missing Maps" volunteers have now put an area where 7.5 million people live onto OpenStreetMap for the first time. These efforts, powered by open source tools, are having real life saving impact and been credited for helping stop the spread of Ebola (http://www.fastcolabs.com/3037350/elasticity/inside-the-crowdsourced-map-project-that-is-helping-contain-the-ebola-epidemic) and improving the Nepal Earthquake response (http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-04/28/mapping-nepal-after-the-earthquake)</p>

SUMMARY:Tackling non-determinism in Hadoop
DESCRIPTION: <p>Developing and maintaining distributed systems like Hadoop is difficult.The difficulty comes from many factors, but we believe that one of the most important reasons is lacking of a good debugger for bugs specific to distributed systems. (e.g., non-deterministic hardware faults, message ordering, ..)</p><p>In the talk, we will show Earthquake, our open-source debugging framework for distributed systems.Earthquakes permutes Ethernet packets, Filesystem events, Java/C function calls, and injected faults in various orders so as to control non-determinism in the cluster.Basically, Earthquake permutes events in a random order, but the user can write his/her own state exploration policy (in Go language) for finding deep bugs efficiently.</p><p>We will also share our successful stories about testing some Hadoop components with Earthquake.For ZooKeeper, we found a distributed race condition bug which decreases availability of a ZooKeeper cluster.We also reproduced a known ZooKeeper bug that no one had successfully reproduced for 2 years, and analyzed its cause.For YARN, we found a disk-fault tolerance bug that inappropriately marks faulty node as healthy.We also found bugs of non-Hadoop softwares, such as etcd.</p><p>With Earthquake, you can also test your real distibuted systems without any modification.</p>

SUMMARY:Build your world in webVR: MOzVR to rescue
DESCRIPTION: <p>The goal of this workshop will be to show and explain how easily you can recreate awesome and immersive user experience using webVR. We will use a set of HTML tags to describe 3D scenes in the browser.</p><p>We use three.js to render the new tags but the aim will be to provide a way to declare 3D scenes independent from the rendering engine. This workshop will show how it will be done without actually delving too deep into programming in three.js</p>

SUMMARY:How can I contribute?
DESCRIPTION: <p>"How can I contribute?" is a panel discussion for everyone who works in "design" (visual designers, graphic designers, interaction designers, researchers).</p><p>This discussion panel is for people like me: people who use open source software daily, who promote open source software to others, and who want to contribute to open source projects but aren't sure where to start. The panel will be made up of designers, researchers, and developers who are already working in open source software.</p><p>The goal will be to give the audience some beginning steps to make a start in contributing to OSS projects. The panel will begin the discussion, and the objective will be to take questions from the audience.</p>

SUMMARY:Reproducible and Customizable Deployments with GNU Guix
DESCRIPTION: <p>“It used to work perfectly, then I upgraded something, and somehow…”  Sounds like a déjà vu?  Sometimes feel like software deployment is unpredictable?  Ever wondered if you can trust your compiler or the integrity of those binary packages you have downloaded?  Falling for VM/Docker images to address the shortcomings of “traditional distros”?</p><p>This talk introduces GNU Guix, a package manager that implements the <em>functional package management</em> paradigm pioneered by Nix to address these issues.</p>

SUMMARY:Privacy and Tracking protection in Firefox
DESCRIPTION: <p>Surveillance is a growing concern in Europe, and Mozilla believes that privacy and security should be treated as fundamental and not optional in the browsing experience. That's why Firefox has introduced new features for tracking protection and private browsing. Do not track is not only a way to navigate the web, it might also become part of a new privacy law in the EU. We will discuss how this has been implemented in the newest version of Firefox, next steps, and why it's important to have transparency and control in our online experiences.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>i-score is an intermedia sequencer dedicated to interactive scenario authoring. Designed as a generic data sequencer, this open source software allows a remote dialog with various applications, such as Max, Pd, Live ... using show-control protocols like OSC to store and recall parameters value.</p><p>Founded by the National French Research Agency project OSSIA, the 1.0 version of i-score proposes a graphical formalism to set precise temporal and conditional relationships between events that can be interactively triggered. The edition and the execution of several independant time layers offer an unique way to manage parameters automations being attended by tools to interpolate states or to draw your own curved breakpoint function.</p><p>As the result of continuous discussions between scientists, ingeneers and users, the presentation will be articulated around well known issues identified during the development of setups for show-control or interactives setups used in museographic situations.</p>

SUMMARY:TLS and SIP - what works and what doesn't?
DESCRIPTION: <p>TLS and SIP - The Session initiation Protocol - is not a match made in heaven. In the original RFC TLS wasn't really handled well and TLS usage has changed since then, in many RFCs. There are still some issues to handle, as well as ideas about how to apply DANE - TLS verification based on DNSsec. This talk explains TLS, the current usage in SIP, how SIP Outbound comes into play and what's needed in order to proceed with a high degree of interoperability.</p>

SUMMARY:Frosted Embedded POSIX OS
DESCRIPTION: <p>FROSTED is an acronym that means "FRee Operating System for Tiny Embedded Devices".The goal of this project is to provide a free kernel for embedded systems, which exposes a POSIX-compliant system call API.In this talk I aim to explain why we started this project, the approach we took to separate the kernel and user-space on Cortex-M CPU's without MMU, the collaboration with the libopencm3 project to provide a high quality hardware abstraction layer and the future goals of the project. Of course there will a demo showing our latest developments: dynamic loading of applications and possibly TCP/IP communication.</p>

SUMMARY:Open Source is being ruined and it’s all our fault
DESCRIPTION: <p>From the zealots of the past to the entrepreneurs of today open source has changed how businesses, non-profits, and individuals run software. Over the past 10 years this has expanded into the realm of hardware both in design and manufacturing. In this talk we analyze how we both help and hurt ourselves and figure out how to ensure the best possible outcome.</p>

SUMMARY:Tarantool: an in-memory NoSQL database and execution grid
DESCRIPTION: <p>Tarantool is an open source in-memory database and execution platform, based on Lua. The database supports transactions, secondary keys, replication, triggers, and the application server provides an inside-the-database semantics for cooperative multitasking and non-blocking I/O. This presentation focuses on a practical use case: task queue application, using Tarantool as an application server and a database.</p>

SUMMARY:The road to liberating software at the lower levels
DESCRIPTION: <p>Liberating the software running at the lower levels of the hardware we use, either on the main processor or on controllers and peripherals can reveal to be quite challenging. There is a series of (more or less) usual limitations to overcome in the process, each of them being a challenge for free software developers, with the potential of fatally blocking a free software implementation.</p>
