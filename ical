SUMMARY:Software isolation issues
DESCRIPTION: <p>For the development of openconnect VPN server a decision to compartmentalize the server was taken, in order to protect any sensitive values exchanged, ranging from the user transferred data, to the data used during the authentication process.This talk will summarize the issues faced during that development that relate to software isolation. That would cover issues with protecting the server's keys via TLS, the client-side authentication of TLS, and PAM authentication, and how they were solved (or not).</p>

SUMMARY:QGIS Tool for Landslide Hazard Assessment
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Southern Kyrgyzstan, large areas are affected by high landslide activity, which regularly results in casualties and economic losses. There have been many efforts in the past and the present to analyze landslide activity in this large data-scarce region. Yet there is a need for creating a system capable of integrating all of the existing information and include the possibility for future updates. Due to the limited funds and multiple end users, minimization of costs and flexible accessibility are requirements for such a system opting for the use of open source software.</p><p>The presented tool has been developed as a QGIS plugin. That way, it is possible to take advantage of the core QGIS functionality and other plugins, e.g. the OpenLayers plugin. The plugin allows the user to access the data on landslides, their triggering and predisposing factors in an easy-to-use way. A typical workflow includes querying landslide and factor data for a certain time period and then assigning them to mapping units for further analysis. Besides data queries, the plugin offers tools for spatial analysis, e.g. finding the highest point of the landslide polygon as an approximation of the landslide main scarp, extension of the standard zonal statistics functionality for the derivation of landslide attributes, pixel- or polygon-based calculation of earthquake influence, etc.</p>

SUMMARY:PixelVault: Using GPUs for Securing Cryptographic Operations
DESCRIPTION: <p>Protecting the confidentiality of cryptographic keys in the event of partial or full system compromise is crucial for containing the impact of attacks. The Heartbleed vulnerability of April 2014, which allowed the remote leakage of secret keys from HTTPS web servers, is an indicative example. In this paper we present PixelVault, a system for keeping cryptographic keys and carrying out cryptographic operations exclusively on the GPU, which allows it to protect secret keys from leakage even in the event of full system compromise. This is possible by exposing secret keys only in GPU registers, keeping PixelVault’s critical code in the GPU instruction cache, preventing this way even privileged host code from accessing any sensitive code or data.</p><p>Due to the non-preemptive execution mode of the GPU, an adversary that has full control of the host cannot tamper with PixelVault’s GPU code, but only terminate it, in which case all sensitive data is lost. We have implemented a PixelVault-enabled version of the OpenSSL library that allows the protection of existing applications with minimal modifications. Based on the results of our evaluation, PixelVault not only provides secure key storage using commodity hardware, but also significantly speeds up the processing throughput of cryptographic operations for server applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Cache2k, Java caching turbo charged
DESCRIPTION: <p>The development of cache2k has two streams: It is a robust cache implementation and provides features we miss from other products, on the other hand it is a research area to try out new caching algorithms and implementations to achieve the best performing in-memory Java cache that is available today.</p><p>The talk will start with some real-world scenarios and challenges and how the cache can help, making it the pivotal point in an application to manage data resources and provide them on time. The second part of the talk will be about modern and adaptive caching algorithms and why you should not implement yet another "LRU cache" by yourself.</p><p>This talk should encourage to use more caching to speed up applications and, of course, to hack and improve existing caching products. There is still much to achieve!</p>

SUMMARY:Bridging the gap between simulation and GIS
DESCRIPTION: <p>Polygonal meshes are the most common way of representing 2D geometries for simulation purposes. Integrating simulation to a GIS requires  storing georeferenced meshes in a databases (or using standard SIG file formats), and being able to use simulation values interpolated over the elements as a map layer.</p><p>This presentation reviews what is the closest you can get with existing FOSS GIS solutions and what is needed to bridge the gap, both on the simulation side and on the GIS side.</p><p>We show the few lines that need to be added to the simulation code to read a mesh from the GIS and write the results to the GIS. We also present a prototype mesh layer for QGIS that has been implemented as a PluginLayer.</p>

SUMMARY:Sustaining the zero assembler port in OpenJDK: An inside perspective of CPU specific issues
DESCRIPTION: <p>OpenJDK comes with a zero assembler port called Zero. Back in 2009 when Zero was originally developed by Gary Benson, OpenJDK was available only on x86, x86_64 and SPARK. Despite recent JIT ports, such as the AArch64 and ppc/aix port, Zero still remains relevant for many Linux distributions. For example, at Red Hat we build and use the OpenJDK zero variant on PPC/PPC64 and s390/s390x. What's more it's a useful tool for getting new JIT ports built from source using free software.</p><p>This talk will give a brief summary what Zero is and how it works. It will cover some of the recently discovered issues with sustaining the Zero port, how we try to catch them early and it will explain our experience with pushingfixes upstream. There will also be examples how this effort benefits the OpenJDK ecosystem as a whole.</p>

SUMMARY:Orchestrating computer systems, a new protocol
DESCRIPTION: <p>Trying to control multiple computers in live performances is a challenging task. Often computers intercommunicate using fixed or manually configured parameters. However when projects expand across many devices this is hard to maintain, especially in situations where parameters are prone to change. ZOCP is a new protocol which solves this problem by facilitating flexibility and autonomous configurations in an orchestrated environment.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Most people who work with computers have no idea how the computers keep time.  All networked computer  systems require some form of temporal synchronization.  As networks have gotten faster the demands for accurate, distributed, timekeeping have increased, but most programmers have no idea about the quality of the clocks in their systems, nor how they might be kept in sync.  This talk will go over the basics of computer clocks, why they're inaccurate, and what can be expected from various strategies for getting systems into sync.</p>

SUMMARY:Using Firefox to debug web apps on any device
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging mobile apps in a world of multiple platforms will always be a classic case of "write once, debug everywhere". A monoculture avoids this problem, but brings a boatload of others, so there is really no way around that. Once we come to terms with this fact however, we can start demanding more from the tools that we use to do said debugging. Do we really have to become proficient in a multitude of tools, one for each platform that we intend to deploy on? How often must we context-switch and app-switch in order to get things done?</p><p>The Firefox Developer Tools Adapter presents a unique approach to the aforementioned problem. In this talk we will dive into the design and implementation of the Adapter, explain why it is a valuable addition to the mobile developer's toolchest and discuss how it can be used to solve real-life problems.</p>

SUMMARY:A dedicated kernel named TORO
DESCRIPTION: <p>In systems with high-grade multiprocessing, we have identified two bottlenecks: in the accessing of the memory bus and in the shared resources. To deal with these issues, we propose a dedicated kernel named TORO that is optimized to run a single multi-threading application. TORO is demonstrating an innovative operating system by integrating at the same ring level both kernel and the user application server. In addition, the accessing to resources (e.g., Filesystem, Networking, Memory) is dedicated to specific processor. Then, only the CPU where is dedicated the resource is allowed to access to the instanceof the resource. As a result of this design, the kernel provides direct access to all resources without any overhead, and therefore maximizesperformance for the overall system. To sum-up the approach, in TORO, the threads of the user application server are distributed evenly on all CPUs and running independently in parallel. The memory model chosen is NUMA without pagination. During the initialization, the memory is divided proportionally for each processor installed on the system. When a thread needs memory, the memory allocator returns a free block of memory depending on which CPU the thread is running. In the same way, TORO can dedicate resources to specific processor, i.e., a FileSystem. This only CPU then can access tothis instance of FileSystem. The scheduler is based on the cooperative threading model, therefore due to this design, TORO can migrate threadsbetween CPUs and send messages between threads without using any lock instruction.</p>

SUMMARY:Qucs: overview, status and roadmap
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk presents Qucs (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) features, the current status of development and the project roadmap.</p><p>Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator. The graphical user interface (GUI) is used for schematic capture and visualization of simulation results. It can simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behavior of the circuit. The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types such as DC, AC, transient, S-parameter, noise analysis, harmonic balance analysis. Digital simulation and circuit optimization are integrated into the GUI and powered by other open-source tools (Icarus-Verilog, freeHDL, ASCO). Besides the library of components it also includes tools for the design of active and passive filters, transmission lines, attenuators and matching circuits. Interfaces for Matlab/Octave and Python are also available.</p><p>The talk will provide an overview of the features and available tools along with a selection of examples. It will present the latest developments including: migration towards the latest Qt framework; new features related to the “turn-key” Verilog-A (ADMS) model compiler as well as support for other simulation engines (ngspice). The project goals are ambitious. This talk aims at presenting what Qucs can offer as well as tease the audience into thinking what is achievable with the open-source EDA tools available today.</p>

SUMMARY:Identity Crisis: Are we who we say we are? 
DESCRIPTION: <p>Karen Sandler, Executive Director of the Software Freedom Conservancy, will discuss the peculiar tension in the intersection of free and open source software and corporate interest. Working in free software often triggers a complicated set of allegiances. When tricky situations arise how do developers decide what their priorities are? As a community how do you know whether a contributor is advocated the best for the project of the best for their employer? How much can governance help? And at the end of the day, how do the ideological components to these projects really play out? And how should they?</p>

SUMMARY:Thou shalt not leak your keys: Practical key privilege separation using Caml Crush
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Heartbleed vulnerability made one thing very clear, current TLS stacks lackan efficient way to isolate the cryptographic material from the applicationlayer. Hence, this vulnerability required the massive renewal of private keysand certificates. This sure was a costly and painful process for ITdepartments. The most efficient approach consists of using Hardware SecurityModules or smartcards to store the cryptographic material. Keys remainconfidential while being usable through an API to perform cryptographicoperations.PKCS#11 is a standardized security API that is widely adopted bydevice vendors. However, deployment of such hardware can be costly andinconvenient in many scenarios. We propose using Caml Crush, a PKCS#11filtering proxy, in combination with software PKCS#11 tokens. This architectureleverages process isolation between the TLS stack and the cryptographicmaterial. This low-cost alternative is immediately applicable to PKCS#11compliant software. We demonstrate that this architecture has a low performanceoverhead by benchmarking the impact on web hosting scenarios.</p>

SUMMARY:GRASS GIS 7: Efficiently processing big geospatial data
DESCRIPTION: <p>You see beautiful maps every day, you use geospatial data every day but do you know what's behind processing all the big geospatial data? With the advent of open geospatial data in Europe new opportunities arise. In our presentation we show GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, http://grass.osgeo.org), a software suite for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and map production, spatial modeling, and visualization. The software has been developed as FOSS for more than 30 years by a large community of developers and users.After six years of development and a long beta release cycle the new stable GRASS GIS 7.0 release is imminent. GRASS GIS 7 is rich in functionality, it offers e.g. enhanced vector network analysis, voxel processing, support for massive time series data management, an animation tool for raster and vector map time series, a graphical image classification tool, and a "map swiper" for interactive maps comparison. The software is portable among most operating systems including GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD, AIX, SUN Solaris, other Unix based, and MS-Windows.</p><p>GRASS GIS 7 offers a new Python API (PyGRASS) for rapid development of workflows. For working teams, it supports shared data management on networks. It can be used as a geoprocessing backend for Web Processing Service (OGC WPS). For statistics, it comes with an interface to R statistics.</p><p>In our research context, we use GRASS GIS extensively for massive geospatial data analysis on a high-performance computing system (HPC). In our presentation, we illustrate workflows and results using "EuroLST" temperature dataset (http://gis.cri.fmach.it/eurolst/) as an example of data in the multi-terabyte range.</p>

SUMMARY:First Steps in Receiving Digital Information with RDS/TMC
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Radio Data System (RDS) is a digital subcarrier on ordinary FM radio broadcasts that is used to convey a bunch of information including station name, time, alternate frequencies, and optionally traffic information with the Traffic Message Channel (TMC) protocol.Given its ubiquity, narrow bandwidth demands, and frequency band, RDS might be a good first digital project for SDR newcomers, extending the 'Hello World' of SDR, i.e., the FM receiver.RDS can be received with very cheap hardware like the RTL-SDR and simple antennas making the technology accessible for everybody.</p><p>In this talk, I will give a short introduction in RDS / TMC and present the current state of the GNU Radio RDS project.Besides the receiving part, we will also have a brief look in the transmit side that allows you to create your own small radio station including RDS and TMC messages.The information is hopefully just enough to whet your appetite and helps to get you started.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will present LuaRocks, the package manager for modules for the Lua programming language. Lua has successful as a scripting language embedded into applications, especially in the gaming industry. However, its "no-batteries-included" design prevented it from getting traction as a stand-alone application language.LuaRocks was created to target this problem. This talk will discuss the particular challenges of developing a package manager for Lua. With this project, we've been successfully fostering an ecosystem of extension modules, improving reuse of Lua code.</p>

The javaws will suffer a lot by introducing jigsaw modules. What is remaining? The "physical applets" of course! Seriously - the "killing"  feature of applets is that they do not work offline. But similarly to javaws - they can! IcedTea-Web is now removing this boundaries, and what more, it will also allow you to detach applet out from browser - by jnlp shortcut, or by lunching html page by javaws directly. Apart of this, ITW is now  JDK independent and you can run those features on any OpenJDK, even onOracle or IBM JDKs.And except serving you web application comfortably online, ITW allows you to lock this application - even "signed ones"  in sandbox. And of course there is Jogamp project - the awt-less  plugin - How I wish to see it merged upstream!-)<strong><em> Long story short, more security and much much more freedom </em></strong></p>

During the past 10 years, we have seen the community growing but not the number of developers. The conclusions were clear. The price to pay to develop on OpenChange was too high: C language only, very complex, too much knowledge required, too much time before you get visible results. We have addressed all these obstacles and will teach you during this talk how to set up the development environment in no time, understand the basics of the OpenChange REST API and leverage its resources and samples to get first visible results in Outlook today.</p>

SUMMARY:Open Standards for Big Geo Data
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Geo service terminology, coverages represent spatio-temporally varying phenomena, such as sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data; incidentally, these typically are prime Big Data contributors in practice. The OGC unified coverage model encompasses regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes. As opposed to the (abstract) coverage model of ISO 19123, the (concrete) OGC coverage and service model establishes verifiable interoperability while still grounding on ISO 19123. The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) comprises a modular suite for accessing large coverage assets. WCS Core provides simple data subsetting whereas extensions add optional service facets up to ad-hoc filtering and processing.</p><p>By separating coverage data and service model, any service - such as WMS, WFS, SOS and WPS - can provide and consume coverages in addition to WCS. Generally, the WCS suite is appreciated by implementers due to its clear structuring and concise conformance testing, down to pixel/voxel level. Many WCS implementations are available today, such as rasdaman which has proven efficient on 130+ TB datacubes.</p><p>In our talk, we present the OGC coverage data and service model with an emphasis on practical aspects. Presentation will make use of available services allowing participants to recapitulate many of the facets addressed.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Now more than ever, users clamor for software that respects their privacy and protects their security. Free software's natural advantage is that it's almost always the best option to safeguard users in a world where proprietary software so often betrays them. Users want options and we know developers want to provide them, so what are we missing?  Two free software activists, one developer and one community liaison, take turns asking each other questions about their experiences and goals.  All the questions about intent, process, and getting user feedback that you've been wondering about will finally be answered.</p>

SUMMARY:moviCompile: An LLVM based compiler for heterogeneous SIMD code generation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Numerous applications in communication and multimedia domains show significant data-level parallelism (DLP). The amount ofDLP varies between applications in the same domain or even within a single application. Most architectures support a single vector-,SIMD-width which may not be optimal. This may cause performance and energy inefficiency. We propose the use of multiple(heterogeneous) vector-widths to better serve applications with varying DLP. The SHAVE (Streaming Hybrid Architecture VectorEngine) VLIW vector processor is an example of such an architecture. SHAVE is a unique VLIW processorthat provides hardware support for native 32-bit (short) and 128-bit (long) vector operations. Vector arithmetic unit (VAU) supports128-bit vector arithmetic of 8/16/32 − bit integer and 16/32 − bit floating point types. Scalar arithmetic unit (SAU) supports 32-bitvector arithmetic of 8/16 − bit integer and 16 − bit floating point types.</p><p>The moviCompile compiler is an LLVM based commercial compiler targeting code generation for SHAVE processor family.The moviCompile compiler is capable of SIMD code generation for 128-bit (long) and 64-bit vector operations. This work focuseson compiler backend support for 32-bit (short) vector operations. More specifically, this work aims to generate SIMD code forshort vector types (e.g. 4 x i8, 2 x i16, 2 x f16) that can be executed on 32-bit SAU next to the 128/64-bit SIMD code. As aresult, moviCompile is able to generate heterogeneous assembly code consisting of both short and long vector SIMD operations.</p>

SUMMARY:JMAP
DESCRIPTION: <p>For the past 4 years, FastMail has been working on a next generation email protocol for our web interface.  We have years of experience writing email clients and servers, and we know where the pain points are.  This protocol is in production right now, and a 30 second demo will show it in action.</p><p>At the moment the email world is divided.  Every vendor is building their own proprietary JSON protocol, because IMAP+SMTP is a really poor fit for mobile apps and even the LEMONADE protocol changes haven't made the experience good enough.</p><p>We want to change that by offering a completely unencumbered standard which is good enough that companies don't need to build their own, and gain an interoperability layer which is better for everybody.  Raise the baseline experience if you will.  We believe it's possible to have a protocol which is both open AND good.</p>

This talk is about our experiences trying make one of the largest ever external contributions to OpenJDK, the AArch64 port.</p><p>I'll talk about how the OpenJDK contribution process works, and how it doesn't work, and how important it is to gain the trust of people inside Oracle's Java team.  I'll discuss the strange asymmetry of being an external contributor to a project but not being able to know all of what is going on.  I'll try my best to explain the baffling role of Projects and JEPs.  I'll speculate about the future of OpenJDK and how it must change as more people outside Oracle contribute significant slabs of code, and how we must have more external patch reviewers.</p><p>Finally, I'll open up the floor for discussion.  I'm sure we'll have a lot to talk about.</p>

SUMMARY:Profiling PHP applications
DESCRIPTION: <p>It's nothing new that speed is important for the success of any web application. Only a few hundred milliseconds may lie between a user leaving your site or staying. Unfortunately performance problems are oftentimes hard to fix and even harder to pinpoint. In this talk I will show you how we at ResearchGate measure web application performance, which means not only timing how long the PHP backend took to deliver a page, but also tracking the speed the users actually perceives in the browser. After that you will see how you can track down and analyze any problems you found through measuring with the help of tools like Xdebug, XHProf and the Symfony Debug Toolbar. And if you still need to get faster after optimizing and fixing all these issues, I'll introduce you to some tricks, techniques and patterns to even further decrease load times.</p>

SUMMARY:Rapid GNU Radio GPU Algorithm Prototyping from Python
DESCRIPTION: <p>Theano is an exciting relatively new open source library which was developed by the machine learning community to accelerate the training of Deep Neural networks and other mathematical algorithms built on scipy by generating compiled kernels for the CPU and the GPU using the CUDA compiler and simple python algorithm definitions.   Since GNU Radio provides native python blocks which execute work functions directly on scipy-style input and output vectors joining these two technologies is a magical approach which allows for the extremely rapid definition of work block mathematical kernels, and the automated compilation and offload onto massively parallel graphics processing unit hardware.  By using this approach we will demonstrate how some highly concurrent and computationally expensive algorithms can be implemented extremely concisely and executed efficiently using graphics processors to accelerate GNU Radio channel models and other blocks with minimal effort.For more information on Theano see: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/theano_scipy2010.pdf and http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5590.pdf</p>

Compact/SPICE models are also a communication means between the semiconductor foundries and the IC design teams to share and exchange all engineering and design information. To explore all related interactions, we are discussing selected FOSS CAD tools along complete technology/design tool chain from nanascaled technology processes; thru the compact modeling; to advanced IC transistor level design support. New technology and device development will be illustrated by application examples of the FOSS TCAD tools: Cogenda TCAD and DEVSIM. Compact modeling will be highlighted by review topics related to its parameter extraction and standardization of the experimental and measurement data exchange formats. Finally, we will present two FOSS CAD simulation and design tools: ngspice and Qucs. Application and use of these tools for advanced IC design (e.g. analog/RF IC applications) directly depends the quality of the compact models implementations in these tools as well as reliability of extracted models and generated libraries/PDKs. Discussing new model implementation into the FOSS CAD tools (ngspice and Qucs as well as others) we will also address an open question of the compact/SPICE model Verilog-A standardization. We hope that this presentation will be useful to all the researchers and engineers actively involved in the developing compact/SPICE models as well as designing the integrated circuits in particular at the transistor level and then trigger further discussion on the compact/SPICE model Verilog-A standardization and development supporting FOSS CAD tools.</p>

SUMMARY:MappedByteBuffer.hurray()
DESCRIPTION: <p>Java is a great language for rapid prototyping. For those interested in multimedia and UI design in Linux, however, there are limited options that provide a varying degree of performance and feasibility. It is quite straightforward to perform I/O on a Video 4 Linux device or the Linux framebuffer in C, but not as straightforward in Java. The end result of this project enables Java programmers program devices like the Linux framebuffer much ease as they use byte[] and int[] classes. An interactive demonstration will be made available as part of the workshop. Moreover, the implementation demonstrates speedups of up to 150x in MappedByteBuffer I/O.</p>

We can start from very simple "checkout, build, test and deploy" idea and we might come to some complex scheme of interconnected tasks or jobs with different pipelines fulfilling certain requirements, but we mostly remain within the process scope dealing with problems like what to automate, how to automate and in which order to run those automated tasks.</p><p>However in this talk we are going to step back a bit and look at CI as an infrastructure, i.e. the system of services, which is constantly evolving to catch up with changes happening in the base project. We will go through number of examples trying to figure out basic principles and common patterns of CI infrastructure, and discuss the ways to solve common problems arising from them.</p>

SUMMARY:Arithmetic based implementation of a quadrature FM Demodulator
DESCRIPTION: <p>One of the key component in many GnuRadio projects is the quadrature frequency demodulator.This functionality allows to calculate the real analog output of a frequency modulated signal fromthe IQ-signal, which is mainly captured using HF hardware (e.g. dvb-t dongle, USRP, etc.) by acarrier frequency (band pass domain) and transform it to the base band domain. The most knownimplementations of the FM-demodulator are based on trigonometric functions. These functionsrequire a high computation effort. Some implementation of “tuned” trigonometric function, whichwere downsized for FM-demodulation reduce the computation effort a little.A new proposal of a so called arithmetic FM-Demodulator allows to avoid completely the usage ofany trigonometric function and speed up the computation process in many times.In the presentation I will introduce mathematical background for the arithmetic FM-Demodulator,show the differences and limitations to the current implementation in GnuRadio Version.Further Philipp will present our result, we had achieved in our lab.</p>

SUMMARY:Diagnosing Performance Issues Using Thermostat
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging performance problems can be a daunting task, especially when you are short on time and lack proper tools that integrate nicely with your custom application landscape. Thermostat was designed to answer the most interesting questions related to performance measurement and application monitoring. It takes advantage of performance metrics and serviceability features of OpenJDK to provide a holistic view of the system. In this session, attendees will get a chance to see Thermostat in action as it is used to analyse programs, gather data, and debug issues affecting performance and functionality.</p>

SUMMARY:Genode - OS security by design
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most provisions against the steadily growing threats imposed by malware, viruses, and directed attacks are fighting symptoms rather than addressing the root of the problem, which lies in the operating system. Genode is an open-source OS technology that promises to give an answer to those threats. By organizing the system as nested sandboxes and consequently applying the principle of least privilege, it protects the privacy of the user and renders most classes of malware ineffective. The talk will be presented on a Genode-based system, which allows the demonstration of the concepts live during the talk.</p>

Although writing an extension can be a daunting task, there's no better way to get to the heart of what exactly Ruby objects are and the reason for some of the language's quirks.</p><p>In this talk, we'll use an example of writing a C extension for Ruby to use a third-party C security library. We'll peel back the layers of Ruby objects to deepen our knowledge of MRI and to understand in a little more detail what it really means to write object-oriented code.</p>

SUMMARY:Improving Key Signing Parties
DESCRIPTION: <p>KSP Tools is a set of tools to simplify and automate the tasks that are needed to attend a key signing party. They will significantly reduce the amount of work needed, and reduce the amount of errors that can be made. My aim is to reduce the amount of work to be done before and after the meeting to just 5 minutes, even with the large amount of people that attend the event at FOSDEM (~100 people), without compromising security.</p><p>I also hope to considerably shorten the amount of time that a key signing party takes through future work.</p><p>The current tools are:</p><ul><li>ksp-makelist: Generates a better formatted key list for usage at a key signing party. It's better looking, more readable, more comfortable to use and can be processed automatically by scanning QR codes.</li><li>ksp-scanlist: Makes a list of keys to sign by scanning QR codes from the above list.</li><li>ksp-list: Performs operations on a list of selected keys like signing keys and mailing them.</li><li>ksp-import-keys: Connects to a mail server and automatically imports signatures people emailed to you.</li></ul><p>The tools automatically check fingerprints and use a file format that is easy to handle with standard tools like grep and awk.</p><p>These tools were made after my experience with key signing parties at FOSDEM and I hope other people will find them useful.</p>

SUMMARY:Viterbi's little Helper
DESCRIPTION: <p>Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a vital part of every communication scheme. Convolutional Error Codes can provide the protection of the data to drive the communication system close to the Shannon Limit. But due to the complexity of the decoders, it is challenging to implement these algorithms in software for use in software defined radios (SDR). Available coprocessors, such as graphic processor units (GPU) and single instruction multiple data architectures (SIMD) can dramatically enhance the throughput of such software based receivers. Strategies to start implementing Viterbi- and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Decoders on these coprocessors are presented in this talk. Potential tripping hazards are identified. The effects on the throughput of these algorithms are analyzed and shown.</p>

SUMMARY:Shenandoah - Project overview
DESCRIPTION: <p>Garbage Collection pauses make it hard for Java applications to meet quality of service guarantees.  No matter how fast your application processes requests, a 30 second GC pause is going to ruin any guarantees you might want to make.</p><p>Shenandoah is a new GC algorithm designed to address this issue. We take a simple approach that allows us to do more work while your Java program is running so we can substantially reduce the time the JVM is paused.  Our goal is to be able to garbage collect 100gb+ heaps in under 10ms.</p><p>This talk will focus on the current status of the project, the goals we've met so far, and what we are hoping to achieve in the coming year.  We might even share some performance numbers.</p>

SUMMARY:Java restart with WebFX
DESCRIPTION: <p>The purpose of the WebFX project is to investigate the capabilities of using JavaFX to build rich web applications. Actually, it is an attempt to create a new web where HTML is replaced with FXML — the markup language for JavaFX UI, and the logic can be written in any programming language that is available on top of Java platform from JavaScript, Groovy, JRuby to Java, Kotlin and Scala. Java ReStart is a complimentary project that acts as transport layer for WebFX allowing FXML pages to reference arbitrary Java byte code on a web server and hence any custom JavaFX UI components and Java third-party libraries. In addition, Java ReStart allows to run arbitrary Java applicationsinstantly from a web server downloading only required parts of applications on demand and executing them in parallel with downloading.</p><p>I would like to give an overview of the projects, make a live demo, compare the proposed technologies with traditional web and native clients, show how the technologies differ from Java applets and Java Webstart, reveal benefits in compare with RDP-like approaches. Finally, I will share my vision on how to evolve the projects.</p>

As a result, QA analysts have to make compromises and work in environments that have a different makeup than the production environment, which can create false positives and missed bugs. This presentation will help QA engineers learn how to mitigate the lack of data refreshes by creating modular test cases and use parameters to dissociate the data from the test cases and automation and therefore be able to work with data that you do have in each environment. Additionally, it will dive into how to maximize the environments QA professionals currently have and align them to their testing process to do feature testing and regression efficiently.</p>

SUMMARY:IgProf
DESCRIPTION: <p>IgProf is a GPL, general purpose, cross platform (x86_64, x86, ARMv7-A, ARM64/AArch64), memory and performance profiling tool originally developed 10 years ago in the context of LHC experiments at CERN (*), to enable optimisation of simulation and data acquisition software. It provides detailed, call-stack level, information on where time / energy is spent and memory allocations happen using a variety of techniques varying from dynamic instrumentation to sampled profiling. While not dissimilar from other similar softwares like Google perftools it was specially tailored to profile extremely large C++ applications comprising millions lines of codes, loading thousands of dynamic libraries and with a very high memory allocation frequency. In addition, ease-of-use and the ability to easily share performance profiles between distributed collaborators are important aspects to enable use by a large community of scientists with varying software development skills.</p>

SUMMARY:All your cycles are belong to us
DESCRIPTION: <p>We live in an age in which every person owns two or three devices that are powerful enough to render a few seconds of 3D movies in a while although they are used mainly to send messages via WhatsApp and create selfies for social network consumption. At the same time, all these devices have the closest thing to an universal virtual machine that has ever existed: the JavaScript virtual machined, paired to a (roughly) standard object model that allows anybody with a bit of programming prowess to create programs that can be run anywhere and everywhere.There is great potential for massive distributed computing in this environment, but the ability to tap it a bit farther than sending basic computations is not there yet. In this presentation we will talk about the issues involved in doing so, from basic algorithmic issues to twisted legal issues that can arise when you are using devices you don't own to perform unwitting computations.</p>

SUMMARY:NTF's General Timestamp API and Library
DESCRIPTION: <p>A good timestamp can be a very useful thing.  Unfortunately, most current timestamps don't have enough information in them to be very useful, and they don't "age well"' and are too often not useful outside of the context of where they were taken.  After decades of casual thought, Harlan started to document what information would be needed to have a useful timestamp, and what sort of underlying support would be necessary to produce and use them.  This turned in to a GSoC project in  2013 where a proof-of-concept user-level library was produced, and some work was done to implement the new timestamp format as a core kernel timekeeping structure in a Linux kernel.</p>

SUMMARY:picoTCP for Linux Kernel tinification
DESCRIPTION: <p>By replacing the Linux Kernel's TCP/IP stack with picoTCP, we aim to lower the threshold to use Linux on small embedded systems and bring it to the IoT world. In this case we ran it on a Cortex-M microcontroller with a few MBs of RAM and flash.Using picoTCP inside the kernel results in a reduction of the kernel's size by over 300 kb, while still having all of the TCP/IP functionality an embedded system might need, and more.The talk will start with a demo, then a motivition why we did this, and finally explaining how we did this.</p>

SUMMARY:Caciocavallo, or how we ported OpenJDK from embedded to cloud and still liked it
DESCRIPTION: <p>Caciocavallo has been one of the very first external projects to land in the OpenJDK repository and sponsored by the OpenJDK Porters Group. Named after a delicious cheese we're never tired of eating, it had the original purpose of refactoring the AWT peers to allow different implementations to be added to OpenJDK. The project evolved very quickly until it became itself a full implementation of AWT based on Swing with just enough abstraction to allow custom plugging into the Java2D system for rendering. As time passed, this characteristic was used to implement a GUI testing framework running on offscreen buffers to avoid the usual problems of focus stealing and random mouse moving that plague every other GUI testing framework (here everything is emulated!), and finally a full Web based backend to allow application to run remotely but still be visible on the local screen. This talk will cover the progress we have done over the years, we will show how easy is to implement a new backend and how this project could be used to give Wayland support to OpenJDK. We will show the testing framework and finally we will discuss about WebJDK, an idea to give more web oriented functionality to OpenJDK and use the web backend to enable fully cloud based applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Synthesizing gateware with GCC
DESCRIPTION: <p>Programmable devices such as FPGAs can potentially offer very significant computational power, but implementing efficient solutions on them can be a hard task. Oneof the main obstacles is the usage of hardware description language (HDL), whose knowledge is usually a rare expertise.To overcome or at least to mitigate this issue, High Level Synthesis (HLS) has been introduced: a (semi)-automatic design flow, potentially composed of several methodologies, thatstarting from a high level representation of the specification to be implemented (e.g., from its C/C++ source code implementation) produces its hardware implementation.This talk presents Bambu a free HLS tools based on GCC developed at Politecnico di Milano, that generated synthesizable HDL description starting from ANSI specifications.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Discovery and tracking of data center resources to enable highly accurate server provisioning and software deployments is a complex problem. The inability to make available resources for use in production in a timely and cost effective manner causes overruns across product and feature life-cycles. Automating discovery, provisioning and orchestration cuts down on delays. This talk presents Genesis, an open source ruby DSL developed at Tumblr. Genesis provides a DSL for resource discovery and is part of an open source stack from Tumblr, alongside Phil (Provisioning) and Collins (Orchestration).</p>

SUMMARY:What Three Big Development Trends Mean for Java
DESCRIPTION: <p>As with the past few years, we'll start by examining via various statistical benchmarks where Java is today and how it is performing relative to its competition. We'll mine various communities use and discussion of Java to try and determine where Java ranks today versus its historical performance.</p><p>With that foundation set, we'll examine three important developer trends and the opportunities - or threats - they present to Java. From the convenience of cloud to the challenges of application lifecycles to the fatigue of fragmentation, we'll walk through the basics of the choices and challenges developers are facing today with an eye towards their implications for Java.</p>

SUMMARY:Packed Objects, Object Layout & Value Types - a Survey
DESCRIPTION: <p>Java is often criticized for its lack of supporting C-style structs. This makes it hard to efficiently implement certain type of data structures (like for example arrays of small objects) in Java.</p><p>However, recently there have been several different approaches which try to address this problem. My talk will briefly introduce "Packed Objects", an extension available in IBM's Java SDK 8, "Object Layout", a layout-optimized Java data structure package proposed by Azul Systems and Value Types [3][4], an OpenJDK proposal for immutable, reference-free value objects.</p><p>I will describe the commonalities and differences of the three approaches and explain how they can improve the memory overhead and locality of Java objects.</p>

SUMMARY:QtQuick in Complex Applications
DESCRIPTION: <p>It is well known that QtQuick is cool, trendy, and empowers you to make your applications looking awesome. Various tutorials and talks discuss that and how to do this, but seldom reach the point where they talk about QtQuick usage for more complex use cases than a simple game/a small example text editor. In this talk, I will discuss how the mechanisms in "hybrid" C++ (logic, models, data) and QtQuick (the fancy looking stuff) applications work and what are best practices there. This includes a very brief recap of QtQuick and QML, but mainly focuses on how to access and communicate data from the QtQuick engine that is provided by the C++ models, and the other way around. The talk will conclude with a walk through different pitfalls and best practices when working with QtQuick UIs of significant size.</p>

There is an increasing popularity of adblockers, but most people still don't know how an adblocker actually works. Adblock Plus is the most popular adblocker with over 50.000.000 users, and most other adblockers adopted our approach and even our filters. I would like to explain what those filters do, how they are implemented, and what the limitations are.</p>

SUMMARY:Crypto Wars 2.0 and the Free Software Response
DESCRIPTION: <p>Recent revelations about the scope of government surveillance have touched off renewed interest in encryption and personal data privacy, and prompted technology companies to offer more protections for users' data. In response, the U.S. government has made moves toward increased regulation of encryption software. This talk will discuss the laws regulating surveillance and cryptography, how those laws apply to free software, and opportunities for community response to the new crypto wars.</p>

SUMMARY:To The Moon And Back. Software Defined Radio and High Power transmissions.
DESCRIPTION: <p>Today, GNURadio enthusiasts are in the same situation as radio electronics enthusiasts about 90 years ago: Many ideas sound very promising, but international regulations and national laws prohibit extended experimenting. Radio Amateurs such as Nobel Price winner Joe Taylor (K1JT) have demonstrated that digital signal processing allows moonbounce transmissions also to the private hacker, but also many more thrilling experiments such as airplane scatter and the active use of Amateur Radio satellites. Most, however, require a little more power than those 10 dBm produced by the USRP series. This talk shows how easy it is to make use of the definitions of international Amateur Radio regulations as part of the ITU ruleset and how to get a license according to national laws - and to experiment with GNURadio -and- with high power.</p>

SUMMARY:Over 9000: The Future of JRuby
DESCRIPTION: <p>JRuby 9000 represents the biggest-ever leap forward for JRuby. Not only have we caught up on compatibility (9000 will be 2.2-compatible from release), but we've completely redesigned our JVM-based runtime and have opened our codebase up to the JRuby+Truffle research project from Oracle Labs. The changes we've made will make it easier to keep up with MRI on compatibility and give us the potential to run Ruby as fast as Java or C. The entire Ruby world will change over the next year, and JRuby 9000 will be leading the way. We'll talk about what Ruby's going to look like once JRuby is "over 9000".</p>

SUMMARY:Jitsi Videobridge in Cryptoland: the adventures of a Java WebRTC video router on the road to supporting 1000s of video streams
DESCRIPTION: <p>In Jitsi Videobridge (https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiVideobridge), a WebRTC video conferencing router, encryption and packet signing were among the most expensive components in terms of CPU intensity. We therefore set out on a journey to optimize them as much as possible.</p><p>We would like to share this journey with the Java FLOSS community.</p><p>We are going to present a comparison we have made on the execution times of popular open source implementations of AES and SHA-1 in search of the best performer. Our reference implementations are provided by the pure-Java Bouncy Castle cryptography APIs. Our contenders are an assortment of widely-used Java and cross-platform C code: the SunJCE security provider optimized by Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8, the Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) libraries employed through the SunPKCS11 security provider and the OpenSSL Crypto library accessed with the help of the Java Native Interface (JNI).</p><p>We're going to pit software against hardware in our examination how we can leverage the Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI).</p><p>We're going to look at the performance compromises of transferring bytes between Java and C. Can we beat Java's intrinsics? Will Java New/Non-blocking I/O (NIO) be better?</p>

SUMMARY:Superoptimization
DESCRIPTION: <p>Modern compiler optimization can take almost any code and produce a reasonably efficient binary at the end. However compiler "optimization" doesn't make your code "optimal", just better.</p><p>In contrast, superoptimization can produce perfect code - the fastest, the smallest or the most energy efficient code. The technique, first introduced in the late 80s found in some cases it could do 25% better than the best assembly programmer, and 40% better than the best compiler at the time.</p><p>Free software has always played a central role in superoptimization research, with the GNU Superoptimizer being one of the very first tools constructed.</p><p>However there is a downside. Superoptimization today is incredibly demanding of compute time, so currently it is limited to short instruction sequences. At present it is most valuable in optimizing code hotspots and key library routines, and can also be a valuable aid to the compiler writer for peephole optimization. Recent research has developed new techniques that can make superoptimization more applicable to general code.</p><p>In this talk I will introduce superoptimization and give some examples of the weird and wonderfully short sequences of code it produces. I will introduce the GNU superoptimizer and show how it is used, including some of the recent improvements I have contributed. The final part of my talk will look at the latest research including machine learning and constraint solving, and show how in future superoptimizers may be able to optimize much larger programs.</p>

SUMMARY:The challenges of open mobile design
DESCRIPTION: <p>Designing in the open has inherent difficulties as the danger of producing a camel always lurks. At the same time the status quo in mobile UI is consumption-oriented. These are the big challenges we face when working on Glacier UI for nemomobile and I believe they are worth talking about.</p><p>This talk starts with a brief introduction on ways to handle the risk of losing the vision and coherence of the design while still fostering participation, and how we are trying to do that on the nemomobile project. Being friendly and accepting proposals and at the same time keeping a grip on the focus of the design, in a project that lives exclusively on contributors' free time: compromises, solutions and ideals. A quick overview of the tools and workflow follows, and the rest of the presentation delves into the specifics of mobile OS interface design and how we try to evolve a mobile UI that enables productivity on a small screen as opposed to mere content consumption, with Glacier UI.</p><p>For more information on nemomobile and Glacier UI visit http://play.qwazix.com/grog/</p>

SUMMARY:Superturbocharging Firefox OS app development with node-firefox
DESCRIPTION: <p>Did you know that every Gecko runtime can be debugged and controlled remotely using the Firefox DevTools remote protocol?</p><p>In this talk we'll look into the architecture of debuggable runtimes, how to speak protocol.js and how we're using it to build a series of node modules that together act like a WebIDE command line counterpart, but might also be incorporated into existing typical web development workflows using tools such as Gulp or Grunt. We'll also talk about the challenges that we've faced when taking this from a hack into a solid product, and some of the most promising features that this work makes possible: faster app development and filling the gaps on the Firefox OS Cordova/PhoneGap plugins.</p>

SUMMARY:What Could Microkernels Learn from Monolithic Kernels (and Vice Versa)
DESCRIPTION: <p>Some developers of both microkernel and monolithic operating systems view the design of their system as absolutely superior to the other design. This black-white thinking and "holy war" attitude, while understandable to a certain degree, makes it hard to to acknowledge that one size does not necessarily fit all. Rather than striving for an unreachable goal of creating the best operating system design for all possible use cases it is vital to understand and reflect the trade-offs of the use cases at hand. This talk focuses on a few features and properties of the current monolithic operating systems that could be an inspiration for the current microkernel operating systems and vice versa. The talk should also initiate a discussion about some "non-goals" of microkernel operating systems that are nevertheless sometimes presented as goals of microkernel operating systems, to the detriment of its own cause.</p>

SUMMARY:Mozilla ID - Developing and protecting a living brand
DESCRIPTION: <p>I propose to introduce the audience to Mozilla's new brand project Mozilla ID. Mozilla ID is a very new project, launched in August 2014 and headed by Mozilla's art director Sean Martell. Mozilla ID aims at developing the core pillars for a new, living Mozilla brand, consisting of a word mark and logo. Mozilla's aim with the project is to allow unlimited variants of the Mozilla logo which will be based on live community data. There will be a logo generator that Mozilla is currently working on where contributors can select the data feeds and colors and it will output SVG versions of the logo for use. People will be able to customize the look based on the options they choose. Effectively, the openness and community contribution that is at the core of Mozilla's software projects will be transferred also to its branding, enhancing community identification on that additional level.</p><p>I will first of all introduce the project and will show images to illustrate the ongoing creative development process led by Sean Martell.</p><p>Moving on to the protection angle: I will speak about traditional patterns of trademark protection and enforcement and how these are being challenged by the market and marketing realities of our modern times. I will speak about the advantages and appeal of living, or fluid, brands, giving examples (such as Google doodle, MTV, Absolut Vodka, to name but a few).  I will point out risks and provide guidance on how a living brand can bridge the divide between valuable community contribution and identification and the restrictions of trademark protection. Essentially, a living brand can have a steady distinctive core which suffices to maintain trademark protection, while certain of its characteristics may be subject to change, community contribution and innovation. The key challenge is to define the core that is to be the subject of trademark protection, without unduly restricting the process of innovation that makes the brand a living brand.</p>

SUMMARY:The Future of JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: <p>EcmaScript 6 aka Harmony, the next version of the JavaScript language, is now feature frozen and the publication is expected around March 2015. Now is a good time to take a closer look at the new version. It brings new powerful features to the language, making it easier and nicer than ever to program with JavaScript. This includes (but isn't limited to) generators, destructuring patterns, function improvements, classes. The best thing is that you don't have to wait to try them. A lot of these new shiny language improvements are already present in Firefox. If we look a bit further down the path, preparation has already started for EcmaScript 7. The next big thing could be SIMD, Typed Objects ...</p>

SUMMARY:The ARM microJIT, a JIT for the IoT
DESCRIPTION: <p>We have all got used to memory being essentially infinite, however the IoT reopens the constrained device with devices having 256M or less. This project looks at developing an ARM microJIT targeted at these devices. The project is based on the original work I did on the Thumb2 JIT (FOSDEM 2010).</p><p>The project targets the Raspberry PI which is an ideal IoT development/demonstration platform. Unfortunately the Thumb2 JIT does not support the Raspberry PI because the Raspberry PI does not have the Thumb2 instruction set. This is a project which I am working on in my 'free' time and I hope to have a demonstrable port by FOSDEM.</p><p>Finally I would like to have a discussion about the future of this work.</p>

Standard, vendorindependent memory maps are then defined for each kind of MCU peripheral, sothat MCU specific implementation details can be ignored by the MPU.Interrupt events can be spontaneously sent by the MCU to the MPU as writerequests.The protocol is transport independent, only a bidirectional channel is required(for instance rs232 or even a network connection).</p>

SUMMARY:CockroachDB
DESCRIPTION: <h2>CockroachDB a distributed database written in Go.</h2><p>Many NoSQL databases come with a focus on performance, availability and scalability, sacrificing strong consistency guarantees along the way. In effect, this shifts the burden of providing consistency to the application, and often results in complex and error-prone application logic.Just a few years ago, an intense effort by Google resulted in Spanner - a globally distributed, replicated datastore that puts transactions back where they belong: right into the heart of the database.</p><p>CockroachDB is a grass-roots effort to bring to the table the guarantees of Spanner (and more) in an open source scalable database that is easy to deploy and, despite the name, quite attractive to have around.</p>

SUMMARY:Truffle: A tour through a new Ruby implementation
DESCRIPTION: <p>JRuby+Truffle is a new high performance implementation of Ruby being built as an open-source research project at Oracle Labs. It uses state-of-the-art research into techniques for writing interpreters and dynamic compilers that allows it to be both significantly faster than any other implementation of Ruby, but also conceptually simpler.</p><p>In this talk we'll explain how JRuby+Truffle works. We'll cover the whole system from the parser to emitting the actual machine code bytes - and we won't have to leave our Java IDE to do it.</p><p>We won't shy away from technical depth where it's needed to uncover all the details, but Truffle is designed to be a high-level and simple system accessible to non-experts. Novices will get an insight into the big ideas, and experts will be able to find out how it all really works.</p>

SUMMARY:Keccak and SHA-3: code and standard updates
DESCRIPTION: <p>In April 2014, the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published the draft FIPS 202 standard for the SHA-3 hash functions and the SHAKE extendable-output functions (XOFs), all based on the Keccak sponge function. Since the selection of [Keccak][http://keccak.noekeon.org/] as the winner of the SHA-3 cryptographic open competition, NIST announced that they will exploit Keccak's abilities for other purposes than just hashing, including key derivation, pseudo-random bit generation, authentication and (authenticated) encryption.</p><p>A first part of the talk will be to give a summary of the current developments around Keccak and the FIPS 202 standard.</p><p>In the meantime, we have gathered the most efficient implementations of Keccak, SHA-3 hash functions and SHAKE XOFs in the [Keccak Code Package][https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage]. These open source implementations are organized in a way that aims satisfying both the developer of optimized code and the cryptographic user. Central to this organization is a specific internal interface that allows interchangeable optimized codes and a user-friendly set of external services.</p><p>As a second part of the talk, we will briefly present the current status of this development and how the FOSS community can benefit from (and contribute to) this effort.</p><p>This is a follow-up of the talk "Keccak: more than sha3sum" at FOSDEM 2013.</p>

SUMMARY:Modularizing C software with Apache Celix
DESCRIPTION: <p>Join the world of service oriented programming with all its benefits - but without its usually found shortcomings - with Apache Celix.Apache Celix is a framework for service oriented programming in C, with a focus on a low overhead, and a small footprint.</p><p>Service oriented programming brings a lot to table; It enables us to design and develop software applications in small cohesive modules, which interact based on loosely coupled services. This helps to control complexity of an application, keep the code maintainable, and promotes reusability.</p><p>In this presentation the concept behind Apache Celix and how Apache Celix can be used to develop modular C applications will be explained.</p>

SUMMARY:When performance matters ...
DESCRIPTION: <p>Python applications sometimes need all the performance they can get. Think of e.g. web, REST or RPC servers. There are several ways to address this: scale up by using more processes, use Cython, use PyPy, rewrite parts in C, etc.</p><p>However, there are also quite a few things that can be done directly in Python. This talk goes through a number of examples and show cases how sticking to a few idioms can easily enhance the performance of your existing application without having to revert to more complex optimization strategies.</p>

SUMMARY:Modern SQL in PostgreSQL
DESCRIPTION: <p>SQL has gone out of fashion lately—partly due to the NoSQL movement, but mostly because SQL is often still used like 20 years ago. As a matter of fact, the SQL standard continued to evolve during the past decades resulting in the current release of 2011. In this session, we will go through the most important additions since the widely known SQL-92, explain how they work and how PostgreSQL supports and extends them. We will cover common table expressions and window functions in detail and have a very short look at the temporal features of SQL:2011 and the related features of PostgreSQL.</p>

SUMMARY:The Wisdom Of Crowd Testing OpenJDK
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the beginning, there were bugs. In order to find them faster, before  a JDK release, the OpenJDK Adoption Group began a quality outreach effort. Initially focused on JDK 8, the effort expanded to cover JDK 7  Updates, JDK 8 Updates and JDK 9 OpenJDK Projects. It now lists dozens of open source projects and communities that participate in testing early access builds of the JDK, report issues they find, and help get them resolved in time.</p><p>In this session, you'll learn what worked, and what didn't, and what you can do to join the OpenJDK crowd testing fun with your own open source project to help us find showstopper bugs before they can bite.</p>

SUMMARY:Overpass API
DESCRIPTION: <p>Using OpenStreetMap data almost always requires filtering for thematic extracts. Overpass API is a web service for this purpose, available at overpass-api.de. Its source code is licensed under AGPL.</p><p>The open data project OpenStreetMap aims at creating a geographic database of the entire world, i.e. collecting the data necessary to make any map of what is on the ground. Starting in 2004, it has now grown to more than a million registered mappers. In most places details are mapped including each footpath. In some places even streetlamps, trees, wastebaskets, and similar things are mapped.</p><p>Overpass API allows you to extract data by geographic search criteria, by subject, by structual properties or an arbitrary combination of them. In this way you can realize an always up-to-date data overlay on a slippy map, a desktop data browser, conveniently pull data from OpenStreetMap into QGIS, do quality assurance or a lot of other things.</p><p>In this talk I will present Overpass API by the above mentioned example use cases. Furthermore, I will give a short overview over the components and the query language. This gives you a starting point to integrate OpenStreetMap data into your application of choice.</p>

SUMMARY:Requirements Bazaar
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this Lightning Talk we want to present “Requirements Bazaar 2.0” that aims to be a social platform to bring developers and end-users together. In years of research we have developed and actually operated an Open Innovation Platform for gathering requirements for prototypes in large international academic projects. The last version of the current product is available under http://requirements-bazaar.org . End-users can enter their requirements by providing short descriptions including user stories, screenshots and other images. The requirements can then be shared amongst its users. On the other side of the chain, developers may take up ideas and transfer the accepted requirements to an issue system like JIRA.</p><p>Over the last years it turned out that people want more lightweight and mobile-friendly tools; we found the old monolithic system to be very hard to maintain to add new features. Therefore we are currently redeveloping it from scratch integrating many ideas from our users and incorporating new research findings. We are further driven by a mobile-first approach to support a wide variety of devices. We additionally want to support various social features like sharing on social networks or blogs and allowing discussions and rating amongst end-users and developers.</p><p>At FOSDEM we would like to encourage open source developers in rethinking the way requirements are currently gathered from the crowd. How do we want to collect new software ideas or simply feature requests from our users. Will it really be through feedback forms in our apps’ “About” menu? Do our users really think in terms of issues like we developers do? How can gamification be used to reward actual end-users of software? We hope Requirements Bazaar can answer these questions and fill the gap!</p>

SUMMARY:Every pixel hurts
DESCRIPTION: <p>Design is still a pretty closed process, so I started exploring ways of opening the design process, just as the coding process has been fully opened through collaboration tools, community building, pair acceptance and sharing knowledge. The design community does not have a strong collaboration history. But, since the appearance of the latest UX practices, there is an opportunity to fully open up the process, as UX is based on research and more graphic designers are moving into the UX field.</p><p>We already know there is a lack of UX practice in FOSS projects, so this talk is a further exploration on why such a gap exists, and a collection of ideas and tools that could (hopefully) empower both sides to put a bridge over it.</p>

SUMMARY:Gradual Typing in Python
DESCRIPTION: <p>Gradual typing in dynamic languages is becoming popular. The implementations for Python, Lua, Clojure and Racket show how a dynamic language can be retrofitted with static type checking. This makes possible to combine the flexibility of these languages with the guarantees of a type checker and can be done in a gradual, non-invasive manner.</p><p>In this talk we'll understand what gradual typing is and the benefits it yields, explore the existing implementations for Python and talk about Guido's plans for the usage of function annotations introduced in Python 3.</p>

SUMMARY:What Lies Beneath?: Lessons learned hacking the OpenJDK interpreter/compilers
DESCRIPTION: <p>What really happens to your Java code along the way to becoming machine code?</p><p>Red Hat has been developing an almost pauseless GC for OpenJDK which requires adding read barriers to every object access. We've also developed ARM64 versions of both the server and the client compilers.  This has given us quite a bit of experience with the internals of the various methods of generating machine code inside the JVM.  This talk will start with a brief tour of the various levels of code generation available and then open up the floor for questions from our panel.</p>

SUMMARY:Make your tests fail
DESCRIPTION: <p>It's easy as pie: before checking in, your test suite should always be green. Or should it? What if your tests are all green but you forgot to check one important edge case? What if your underlying system environment lets you down, but only under rare conditions that you didn't cover in your tests?</p><p>This talk introduces randomised testing as used by projects like Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch based on the Carrotsearch Randomised Testing framework. It has helped uncover (and ultimately fix) a huge number of bugs not only in these project’s source code, but also in the JVM itself which those projects rely on.</p>

SUMMARY:OpenJDK Adoption Group Q&A
DESCRIPTION: <p>There's a ton of stuff going on in OpenJDK, projects, repositories, bug database, experiments. This is a lot of potential fun, but the entrance barrier for newcomers is extremely high, and it's easy to get lost and not enjoy the fun anymore. In order to help people wanting to contribute keep track of this intricate forest of development and find their way out, the Adoption Group was created (http://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/).</p><p>This session is an exchange between few of the hackers directly involved with the Adoption Group and the public. We will indeed discuss some of the projects we are currently involved with - like the planned global hack days for jsonp, jigsaw and tools that use jigsaw and http 2.0 with language interoperability - but above all we will answer questions the audience may have in relation to getting involved with OpenJDK, both from a technical perspective and a social one, so that next year you can sit together with us helping even more people to jump on the fun!</p><p>If you need help organising your next hackday, or you are completelylost tying to get started with OpenJDK, this is the session for you!</p>

SUMMARY:Smart VM scheduling in oVirt cluster
DESCRIPTION: <p>The oVirt project allows efficient management of virtualized datacenters. Deciding what machine should host a certain VM is one of the important functions of the management platform. Unfortunately it is also one of the complex ones, because there can be many rules governing the placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to be started or migration initiated. Till now each VM was considered separately and that caused fragmentation of free resources.</p><p>We are about to present a new solution to this issue in this presentation. We have started a cooperation with the OptaPlanner team that develops an optimization engine based on probabilistic (soft computing) algorithms. This means that oVirt will feed situation updates to an optimization service and continuously receive improved solutions back. It will then use the precomputed results for rebalancing the clusters.</p>

SUMMARY:Free and open-source software for medical imaging
DESCRIPTION: <p>The amount of medical images that are generated, analyzed and exchanged by hospitals is dramatically increasing. Medical imaging is indeed the first step to the treatment of more and more illnesses, such as cancers or cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>In turn, the data management of clinical images and the administration of the computer network of a medical imaging department imply continuously growing technological challenges. Tasks such as autorouting between imaging modalities, exchanging data between clinical departments or hospitals, or anonymizing images are still hard to achieve in practice. This is a direct consequence of the lack of interoperability software that could bring technological independence to hospitals by creating low-cost gateways between proprietary ecosystems.</p><p>In this talk, I will explain the pains behind modern medical imaging, from the perspective of the hospitals. The DICOM standard will be introduced, together with free and open-source software supporting this standard.</p><p>I will then put emphasis on the free software Orthanc, a lightweight, versatile DICOM server. Thanks to its REST API and to its Lua scripting engine, Orthanc is primarily conceived as a central, robust building block to bring technological independence to clinical departments by automating their very specific imaging flows. Orthanc was nominated at the Zénobe Award 2013 for social innovation.</p>

SUMMARY:BIFUZ
DESCRIPTION: <p>We have designed and implemented an Intent Fuzzing Framework for Android.Intents are one of the most important ways used by applications to communicate. They benefit also for a very high level of trust inside the Android OS, so if they are not validated appropriate, they might create an unwanted damage, or might even compromise a mobile device, from Security perspective.As a term, fuzzing implies manipulating input data, in order to validate it through the mechanism or device under test. It is usually a black-box, negative testing technique, but we have used it as a grey-box method, also.Knowing how Intents are built, and which type of parameters they accept and expect, we have been able to craft fuzzed Intents, in order to find Security vulnerabilities in the Inter Process Communication protocol.</p>

SUMMARY:Knowing your garbage collector
DESCRIPTION: <p>As Python programmers we're used to program without taking care about allocatingmemory for our objects and later on freeing them, Python garbage collectortakes care of this task automatically for us.</p><p>Garbage collection is one of the most challenging topics in computer science,there are a lot of research around the topic and different ways to tacklethe problem.</p><p>Knowing how our language does this process give us a better understandingof underlying interpreter and allow us to know why problems like cyclescan happen in CPython interpreters.</p><p>So, this talk aims to be and introduction to the topic and a walkaroundthrough different approaches followed in CPython and PyPy:</p><ul><li>Generational Reference counting with cycles detector on CPython.</li><li>Incremental version of the MiniMark GC on PyPy.</li></ul>

SUMMARY:Leihs, the leading free equipment booking system
DESCRIPTION: <p>leihs is probably the most widely used free inventory management and equipment booking system. Started at the Zürich University of the Arts (ZHdK) in order to manage their own sizeable pool of equipment, it quickly became clear that other organizations have exactly the same problems. It now made sense to release leihs under the GPL. In this talk, Ramón talks about mistakes made, challenges and things learned in the last 8 years of managing a free software project from within a government organization.</p>

SUMMARY:Reinventing the Enlightenment Object System
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Enlightenment project started over 15 years ago, and while it has evolved a lot over the years, its object system has not; this is quite surprising given that almost everything in Enlightenment is represented by objects. Tom, later joined by other Enlightenment developers, has taken upon himself to redesign it, and called the new system Eo. In this talk Tom will describe the main goals they had for Eo, what (and how) they have achieved, how it was received by fellow developers and how it impacted the Enlightenment project as a whole. Tom will also briefly review other C object systems, some of Eo's unique features, and several related projects that were either created to support Eo, had undergone major improvements enabled by it, or owe they existence to Eo.</p>

SUMMARY:Large Scale Quality Assurance in the PostgreSQL Ecosystem
DESCRIPTION: <p>The apt.postgresql.org repository hosts PostgreSQL server packages for seven major releases: all the stable branches plus beta and the devel versions. Targetting two architectures and seven Debian and Ubuntu releases, this is almost 100 combinations in the cross product. On top of that, we build binary packages for various PostgreSQL extensions and applications. Of course no one is able to test thousands of packages manually.</p><p>We are putting much effort into running regression tests on all extensions using pg_regress, and creating system integration tests to be run with the autopkgtest tool. All tests are integrated with our Jenkins build server.</p><p>This talk presents recent advances made in the area and includes examples of bugs found.</p>

SUMMARY:XMPP and Android
DESCRIPTION: <p>Using XMPP on resource constraint systems, like Android devices, that are surrounded by a hostile mobile environment impose many challenges. But with the right measures a stable, reliable, push-enabled and battery friendly connection can be achieved. This talk will present the required techniques using Smack, an open source XMPP client library written in Java. One outstanding property of Smack is that it's a multi-runtime library, i.e. it is able to run on Java SE runtimes <em>and</em> on Android.</p>

SUMMARY:Security enforcement by privilege aware launcher
DESCRIPTION: <p>Adding a launcher to a binary allows to control some aspects of its execution environment of the target application.This is used to change the namespace (view of the filesystem) of the target application at launch time.An other mechanism is also setup: the process receives (or not) keys that can be checked by other applications for the purpose of controlling authorisations.When implementing this mechanism, lakes appeared on the extendibility of the /proc kernel's filesystem that we will expose here.</p>

SUMMARY:The power of cross-correlating: from GPS reception to passive RADAR using SDR
DESCRIPTION: <p>CDMA systems rely on encoding data streams radiated by multiple emitters on the same carrier frequency with (ideally) orthogonal codes. Recovering the signal from each emitter requires identifying the code assiociated witheach source, which hence also requires recovering the carrier to account for relative emitter/receiver motion (Doppler shift), thermal drift and oscillator bias. We demonstrate this concept with the reception of GPS signal -- a constellation of satellites orbiting 20000 km over the surface of the earth -- with 20 euro worth of equipment centered on a DVB-T receiver designed for receiving neighbouring television signals. We extend the concept to passive radar, in which a radiofrequency emitter (television, broadcast radio) signal reflected on a mobile target is used for identifying the velocity and position of the target. In this approach, no active source is needed: RADAR measurement is only a matter of correlating the direct and reflected signal, after identifying the Doppler induced frequency shift.</p>

Sounds ambitious? You bet. Maybe it'll actually work out in the end.</p>

SUMMARY:Copyleft in Europe: How does copyleft interact with Exhaustion Of Rights
DESCRIPTION: <p>Copyleft licences work by conditioning distribution of a work's binary on providing access to relevant source code. Under the European Computer Programs directive, once a copy of a computer program has been placed in circulation in the EEA by or with the consent of the copyright holder, the copyright holder can no longer control circulation ("exhaustion of rights"). Is the condition to provide source an attempt to control circulation, and is the exhaustion principle problematic for the GPL and other copyleft licences? Commentators have suggested that this is fatal to copyleft, but we argue these analyses are overblown.</p>

SUMMARY:Yatta: A Real-Time Framework for Peer-to-peer Group Editing on Arbitrary Data Types
DESCRIPTION: <p>Yatta is an open source framework that can be used to collaborate in real-time on arbitrary data types. It is based on a new operational transformation-like approach that can be used in peer-to-peer settings on the Web, using standard communication protocols such as WebRTC or XMPP. Part of the shared editing projects family (e.g. ShareJs, OpenCoweb, etc.), Yatta currently implements support for text, XML and JSON and proved to be very fast and reliable.In this lightning talk we introduce the concepts and features of the Yatta framework and discuss how it can be leveraged to design the next generation of peer-to-peer shared editing tools. We conclude the talk with a short demo that highlights the capabilities of the framework.</p>

SUMMARY:Open source home automation
DESCRIPTION: <p>There are 3 problems with close source home automations systems. i. These systems tend to be ridiculously expensive for the features that they offer, since most vendors target the high-end market segment with customized solutions. ii. Configuring and maintaining the system has to be done by a certified installer, giving the customer little control over their own house. iii. Theses systems use closed-source communication protocols and you -as a user- are not able to interface with the system or change anything in the system.</p><p>OpenMotics is an open source home automation hardware and software system that offers features like switching lights and outputs, multi-zone heating and cooling, power measurements, and automated actions. The system encompases both open source software and hardware. For interoperability with other systems, the OpenMotics Gateway provides an API through which various actions can be executed. The project was open sourced 2 years ago and was started about 10 years. The choice to open source the project was very conscious: we want to offer a system where users are in full control over their home automation system.</p>

SUMMARY:Enabling video preservation through open source
DESCRIPTION: <p>Exactly what codecs and containers should be favored in audiovisual preservation is an ongoing debate with archives while broadcast industries, media production industries, and increasingly open source communities contributing technology that supports the objectives of audiovisual preservation. As the machinery and skills needed to sustain access to film and analog video collections decay it is increasingly urgent for archives to address blocking technological issues in order to re-format legacy audiovisual recordings to digital formats efficiently. The presentation reviews the requirements and demands on technology within audiovisual preservation projects and assesses the opportunities and concerns of open media to contribute to preservation challenges, with a focus on lossless audiovisual codecs, technical and contextual metadata, and both the openness and standardization of relevant file formats.</p>

SUMMARY:PicoTCP on Mobile Ad Hoc networks
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the growing world of the Internet of Things, gathering data from small devices is becoming more and more important. picoTCP is a dual licence open source networking stack specifically designed to target small embedded devices and facilitates a modular way to select support for different networking protocols. Recently a mesh networking solution was added to the stack, enabling support for MANETs as an additional solution for embedded networking problems. In the presentation we will point out the reasoning behind this solution, explain how to use it and show a real implementation example on a physical network.</p>

SUMMARY:Extending Python, what is the best option for me?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Python is a great language, but there are occasions where we need access to lowlevel operations or connect with some database driver written in C or we need toovercome to some speed boottleneck in Python due to some limitation in thelanguage, like NumPy or Scikit-learn do, using extensions.</p><p>With the FFI(Foreign function interface) we can connect Python with otherlanguages like C, C++ and even Rust or Fortran.There are some alternatives to achieve this goal, Native Extensions, Ctypes and CFFI.We'll compare this three ways of extending Python and we'll study pros and consof each approach.</p>

SUMMARY:Why we tried (and ignored) famous IaaS to deliver SecurePass
DESCRIPTION: <p>Our question was: "what is the best infrastructure to run our SaaS on?".We tried most of the infrastructure software, starting from vmware, moving to Proxmox, OpenNebula, OpenStack, and Google's Ganeti. We also considered software storage and software defined networks. We mastered some of these technologies and we even contributed to the projects. But we felt we needed something different and lighter and we "blended" our own solution, mixing and matching the best of the above and keeping in consideration our needs in terms of computing, network and storage. This talk will go through our (long) journey, understanding pros and cons of each technology and describing what we used to deliver SecurePass and other services.</p>

SUMMARY:Towards legal criteria for best practices in free software/open source development
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will propose several ideas for inclusion in a set of modernlegal standards for good practices in FLOSS development and governancebeyond the traditional emphasis on software freedom-conformant sourcecode licensing. The theme will be maximizing diverse, egalitarian andauthentically meritocratic participation, minimizing legalimpediments, and avoiding distortion or corruption by powerful projectstakeholders. Ideas to be discussed include distributed andsymmetrical copyright licensing, fair trademark policies, appropriateapproaches to patent nonassertion by corporate participants, andcommitments by projects or associated foundations to promoting diverseand safe environments for development work.</p><p>Ideas discussed in this talk may form the basis for work done by theOpen Source Initiative during the coming year.</p>

SUMMARY:Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter
DESCRIPTION: <p>In 2009 three Swedish engineers invented a small quadcopter that stated with a simple idea: get an electronic board (PCB) to fly.They created the "Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter" which weighs only 19g and fits in the palm of your hand. It can be controlled from various devices, including PC, Android or iOS device, Raspberry Pi or a R/C remote.While the main client has been written in Python, it has also been ported to Java, C, JavaScript.Since the beginning of last year (2013) the hardware can be bought from http://www.seeedstudio.com, but the schematics for the PCB and the firmware/host source code is also available on their website/Github account.Due to the low cost for the hardware and the open source approach, the Crazyflie has been used in different private and academic science and research projects around the world.</p>

SUMMARY:Fork and Ignore: Fighting a GPL Violation By Coding Instead
DESCRIPTION: <p>Typically, GPL enforcement activity involves copyright infringement actions which compel license violators to correct errors in their GPL compliance,thus yielding the policy goals of the GPL: the rights of developers and users to copy, share, modify and redistribute.</p><p>While traditional enforcement is often undeniably necessary for embedded electronics products, novel approaches to GPL violations are often possible and even recommended for more traditional software distributions.</p><p>Recently, Conservancy engaged in an enforcement action whereby,rather than fight the violator in court, Conservancy instead fostered and provide resources and assistance to a vetted GPL-compliant fork of a violating codebase.</p><p>This talk discusses which scenarios make this remedy optimal and lessons learned. The talk includes some licensing and technical content about vetting licensing information of codebases.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging Java applications is comfortable and simple, but if you want to look beyond the Java horizon, you need special knowledge and and different tools.</p><p>This interactive session shows you how to debug a running VM or analyze a VM core file with a native debugger like gdb. You will also learn how to use some of the more than 1,200 VM options to trace ormodify the VM behavior. This knowledge can greatly help you identify, isolate and reproduce the root cause of hard VM crashes, and it can also be pure fun to see which actual machine instruction the CPU is executing for your Java code.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Termination provisions are a standard component of license agreements. FOSS licenses and FRAND commitments, however, are not standard agreements, as they are founded on ideals of non-discrimination. Termination clauses, which permit licensors to cancel rights of specific licensees, contradict these ideals. The talk will clarify the contradictions between these principles and license termination provisions, explain why termination provisions are nonetheless justified in these models, and illustrate these explanations by reference to a number of current debates.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Compact C Type Format (CTF) is a technology created during development of theD-Trace software to describe the C data types. With its second version itevolved into a fully expressive, yet space-wise efficient format that can beused outside of the D-Trace suite too. Compiling the FreeBSD kernel with theCDDL/CTF option triggers the creation of such CTF data that corresponds to therespective kernel objects. This dataset can be parsed and processed to become asource of information needed to pretty print all kernel data structures insidethe on-line kernel debugger DDB.</p>
